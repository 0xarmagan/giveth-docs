Welcome to the the Giveth Community Circle!

The Community Circle is the living and breathing core of Giveth, where we cultivate learning and support innovative projects with a focus on blockchain for good. We've created a safe space for community members to talk about their passion projects and help them recruit or find help and guidance from peers. We have served as an incubator for many of the projects in our Galaxy [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/), [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/), etc) and this is only the beginning.

Community Calls are held every Sunday in the appropriate voice channel in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DAFkKdkykr) and can be found scheduled on the [Giveth calendar](https://calendar.giveth.io/). Feel free to join us! If you want to get a feel of what we discuss during the Community Call, most of the recordings can be found on our [Giveth Transparency YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdqmP4axeI1hNmX20aZsOwg).

Below you can find an overview of the goals we are working towards.

If you have any question or are interested to contribute, feel free to reach out in the Discord server or [Telegram chat](https://t.me/Givethio).

## Goals
* **Grow the Blockchain4good Initiative:** Provide resources, education and support for community members focusing on blockchain4good & boosting the Ethereum/blockchain ecosystem.
* **Build Community around For-Good Projects:** Create a safe space for community members to communicate their passion projects, then recruit help or guidance from peers.
* **Create a Network of Partners:** Oversee anything beyond basic DApp development in the Giveth Galaxy.
