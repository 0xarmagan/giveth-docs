title: Giveth Community Covenant
---

The Giveth DAO is an eclectic mix of people from the Ethereum and nonprofit worlds, dedicated to revolutionizing philanthropy by encouraging, supporting and rewarding the funding of public goods.

Our vision for the future of giving is to build a free, globally accessible platform where funds flow efficiently, transparently and directly to where they have the most positive impact. We want Giving to be effortless and have people all around the world rewarded for creating positive change. We want our platforms to be self-sustaining and able to fund their growth without charging any fees to donors or projects.

The GIVeconomy is an economic protocol where a digital currency, in this case GIV, is issued and distributed programmatically. GIV tokens are distributed to those who qualify for the GIVdrop, participate in the "GIVbacks" program, earn them through GIVmining, and vote on governance proposals in the GIVgarden. GIV can also be purchased through a DEX.

GIV tokens will be allocated to fund proposals passed in the GIVgarden. GIV distribution from the GIVgarden is henceforth determined by the community who is empowered to use their GIV to vote.

The growth of Giveth, and the ability of successful proposals to support our vision, is directly related to the community's ability to foster an inclusive and welcoming culture that people feel proud and delighted to adopt as their own. When someone chooses to buy or hold GIV and participate in the GIVeconomy, they are implicitly supporting the community's culture, values and norms.

To this end, the  GIVgarden depends on a social contract, which sets expectations for how members should engage both with the Giveth DAO and with one another.

### The Pledge
We as members, contributors and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body shape, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that are in agreement with the Giveth Mission, Vision and Values, and contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive and healthy community.

### Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, while learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### On-chain Enforcement
The on-chain mechanism for enforcement will depend on the completion of Celeste.

The ability for Giveth to enforce this covenant is limited to the direct interactions that community members have with the GIVgarden, specifically the ability for community members to submit proposals to allocate GIV issuance or adjust protocol parameters.

A community member will be required to stake GIV when submitting a proposal, attesting that the impact of the proposal could be reasonably considered to align with Giveth's social contract. A dispute can be created by another community member if they disagree with the proposer's attestation by challenging the proposal and staking an equivalent amount of GIV. If after being challenged the proposal is not withdrawn, a decentralized oracle will be used to settle the dispute.

Participants in the dispute resolution protocol are expected to review the proposal, this covenant and related past disputes in order to provide a judgement that they feel best aligns with the established norms and intention of the Giveth community.

If the oracle responds in favour of the proposer, the proposal will be unlocked and the challenger’s stake will be transferred to the proposer. On the other hand, if the dispute resolves in favour of the challenger, the proposal will be removed from consideration and the proposer's stake will be given to the challenger.

### Off-chain enforcement
Giveth community spaces, including the Giveth Forum, GitHub and Discord, as well as other off-chain forums that may emerge in the future, are expected to adhere to this covenant.
