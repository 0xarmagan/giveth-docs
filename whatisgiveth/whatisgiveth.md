## What is Giveth?
Giveth is a community focused on making the world a better place through the use of blockchain technology. We work on a large scope of projects called the Giveth Galaxy consisting composed of four primary circles:

- The Dapp

- Social Coding

- Communications

- Governance

You can use the Giveth DApp to donate on projects or also propose projects that need funding, all using cryptocurrency! 

We aim to foster a large network of organizations and to build a bright, transparent and decentralized Future of Giving.

## Why should I use Giveth for my project?
The Giveth Dapp is extremely inuitive and can be used to acquire funding for large or small projects. The platform that we have created has been ultra stream-lined allowing you to easily create and share your projects. We allow connectivity of multiple wallets and as well facilitate crypto and fiat donations. In development is the GIV token which you can collect, donate and/or stake to exponentiate your projects funds received.

## Why should I donate to a project on Giveth?
Giveth uses blockchain technology to track and record donations in cryptocurrency and also bridges your fiat donations into crypto which will also be recorded on the blockchain. Also as mentioned above the GIV token functionality is just as exciting for donors as it for project creators. **Stay tuned for updates on the GIV token**.

## Who owns Giveth?
Giveth is ran by a community of Developers and Makers formally known as the Giveth Decentralized Altruistic Community (or DAC). An eclectic mix of people from the Ethereum and non-profit worlds they are driven to provide the tools for anyone to build a global community around a cause.

**What is the roadmap for the Giveth Platform?**
The roadmap for the Giveth DApp(s) is constantly evolving and can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/giveth/Roadmap-5a154f91bf9a417ea31b2edbc925201a).

**Is Giveth recognized as an official charity?**
Giveth is a Decentralized Altruistic Community and with the help of [SDG impact fund](https://www.sdgimpactfund.org/) our DAO and community based organizational structure is represented as a non-profit 501c3 in the United States. We are a community-led project and will not derive any direct profit from the platform. We strive to model the DAC concept as one of the first not-for-profit blockchain based entities. We guarantee all funds will get recycled back into the Community that is ensuring the Giveth Platform gets adopted widely.
