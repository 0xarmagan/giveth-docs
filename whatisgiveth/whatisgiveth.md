Giveth is a Decentralized Altruistic Community and with the help of [SDG impact fund](https://www.sdgimpactfund.org/) our DAO and community based organizational structure is represented as a non-profit 501c3 in the United States. We are a community-led project and will not derive any direct profit from the platform. We strive to model the DAC concept as one of the first not-for-profit blockchain based entities. We guarantee all funds will get recycled back into the Community that is ensuring the Giveth Platform gets adopted widely.
