title: Governance
---

We are moving towards a fully decentralized governance system. We value transparent, holistic governance and hope to be a shining example of it. We readily adopt new innovations that support us in embodying our values. Within the Giveth DAC (Decentralized Altruistic Community), we are documenting anything that could be useful for future decentralized communities like ours (through concepts like Sociocracy, RewardDAO, Liquid Pledging and more).

We have been using the different iterations of our DApp to compensate the team membersâ€™ efforts in a way that shows milestone achievements towards the common vision. We believe in  the self-organizing power of sociocracy, which we apply in the organization of tasks, communication in our Discord channels and during our governance meetings.

### Goals
- **Internal Governance Innovation:** Experiment with and document decentralized governance structures within the Giveth DAC (e.g. Holacracy, Sociocracy, RewardDAO,Conviction Voting, SourceCred, etc.) that could be useful for future Decentralized Altruistic Organizations to learn from and implement (Modeling DACs).

- **Improving the Ethereum Commons:** Get the Blockchain (in Blockchain4Good) going. When Giveth runs into a problem, like scaling, help solve that problem for everyone rather than just ourselves. This expresses itself by collaborating with partners like The Commons Stack, DAppNode, BrightID and 1Hive.

- **Structure & Organization:** Cover basic needs of the Giveth DAC to function, such as creating and maintaining basic team structure, conflict resolution, administration, financial transparency, organization of team gatherings and quality assurance / quality control.

- **Raise Funding:** Oversee donation raising for the Giveth DAC through grants and reaching out to the community.
