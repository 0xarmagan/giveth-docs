The GIVdrop is designed to kickstart the GIVeconomy by distributing GIV tokens to the Giveth trusted seed - crypto philanthropists, Giveth users & builders, Blockchain4Good DAO members, and other ecosystem partners. To check your GIVdrop eligibility or to claim click here. **add link** To learn how to claim your GIVdrop, refer to our tutorial here. **add link**

All addresses have **5 years** from **December 24, 2021** to claim their GIVdrop. After that, any unclaimed tokens will be returned to the Giveth DAO, further increasing the DAO treasury.

## GIVdrop Eligibility

17.05% of the total initial supply (1 billion GIV) has been distributed to our trusted seed. The trusted seed is a group of individuals - previous supporters  10% of these tokens are instantly claimable on xDai as the GIVdrop. The rest initializes and sustains the GIVstream **Add link** - a flow of GIV that becomes claimable gradually and continuously until **November 23, 2026**.

Eligible recipients of the GIVdrop and the associated GIVstream include:

- Giveth Contributors 5.05%

- Past donors to Giveth directly 4%

- Blockchain4Good heroes 4%

- Past donors to projects on Giveth 2%

- Past users of beta Giveth TRACE 1%

- Past donors to Gitcoin Grants in Rounds 1-7 1%

The Blockchain4Good DAO heroes group includes a list of over 2500 unique addresses, with over 60 different groupings. The majority of addresses belong to people who have been identified as crypto donors, with the rest belonging to value-aligned DAO members that are working,directly or indirectly, to further Giveth's mission **add link**.

The snapshot for past donors, contributors and users was taken in March 2021. The snapshot for contributors and Blockchain4Good DAO heroes was taken in September 2021. For donors to Gitcoin Grants, we used an anti-sybil attack measure to remove airdrop hunters from the list.

**IMPORTANT:** We have made every effort to include all valid addresses in this GIVdrop made at our discretion. Not every person who has ever interacted with Giveth is eligible. If you did not receive GIV, that is because you were not eligible or the wallet that stores the address that was eligible can not be accessed. We will not review past transactions or consider other addresses for inclusion. We appreciate your understanding.

If you did not receive the GIVdrop, check out our GIVbacks program to find out how to get GIV! **ADD LINK**

**NOTE:** If you received the GIVdrop but no longer have access to the eligible address, it is possible for us to redirect the allocation to another ETH address. However, you need to prove who you are and that you do have tokens allocated to you. If this is you, reach out to our team for support. FYI - if no one in the Giveth team knows you, it probably won't work out.
