## Your Giving in Action

We love to highlight success stories from your generous donations that show that power of our community.

This month's highlighted project is  [**Feed the Hungry in Chilliwack BC Canada**](https://giveth.io/project/Feed-the-Hungry-in-Chilliwack-BC-Canada-0?utm_campaign=Community+Newsletter+January+2022&utm_medium=email&utm_source=autopilot)**:** A grassroots project providing food to those experiencing homelessness, raised over $129,372 on Giveth. These funds are being used to expand their mission to care for families affected by flooding in BC. 100% of the funds donated went directly to support their cause!
