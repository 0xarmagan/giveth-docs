title: Working with Github issues and Zenhub
---

Please follow these guidelines, when working with Github issues

## Github issue management:

If an issue is in progress for too long (1 week), it may be a sign that it's not clearly defined. In this case, move it back to 'To do', and add a 'question' label.

## New issue templates

The new issue template is a guide only.

## Use of Epics

Epics are for breakup issues into smaller issues

## Milestones

Milestones have a date attached to them
