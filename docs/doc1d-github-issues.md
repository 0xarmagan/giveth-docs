## Zenhub

We Zenhub, [which you can install from here](https://www.zenhub.com/extension).

The use of columns in Zenhub:

Needs Clarification - This issue is not clear enough for someone to start working on.
New Issues - New bugs and features go here first
Backlog - The backlog of issues that are waiting to go into Todo
To do - These issues have been vetted and are ready to be worked on
In progress - this is being worked on this right now
User testing - the feature or bug is deployed on the staging server
Done - the bug or feature has been completed, and is ready to go live
Closed - the bug or feature has been copied live

Please follow these guidelines, when working with Github issues

## Github issue management:

If an issue is in progress for too long (1 week), it may be a sign that it's not clearly defined. In this case, move it back to 'To do', and add a 'question' label.

## New issue templates

The new issue template is a guide only, feel free to delete any heading that you don't use.

## Use of Epics

Epics are for breakup issues into smaller issues.

## Milestones

Milestones have a date attached to them.
