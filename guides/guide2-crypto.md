## Why Cryptocurrency?
Using cryptocurrency for sending and receiving donations has many advantages against using 'fiat' or regular currency. With the implementation of the blockchain crypto transactions are recorded and forever stored on the digital ledger making currency donations and distrubtion transparent. 

## What is and why choose Ethereum?
 Ethereum or Ether is another type of cryptocurrency that was released in 2015. It is consideder the big #2 powerhouse of the crypto world after bitcoin.
 
 One of the outstanding features of Ethereum is the ability to program things RIGHT ONTO its blockchain! This feature gave developers and community leaders actual superpowers at their fingertips...

## How does it work in the context of the application?
So one of these superpowers is to create dApps or Decentralized Applications, these are applications programmed onto the blockchain. dApps can be programmed to work as smart contracts receiving, holding and distributing currency as per the terms wrote into the contract. This feature removes the need for banks or lawyers, cutting through red tape and allowing project creators more autonomy.

One of the other superpowers is the ability for developers to create tokens or 'coins' which can create alternative economies based on the functionality programmed onto the coin. 

So both of these superpowers exist on the ethereum blockchain an when a project is created and donated to you're creating essentially a smart contract with your project and you can dictate which type of tokens, coins or currency you want to receive as contributions to your project.
