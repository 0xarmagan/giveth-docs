We [asked](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-make-it-so-manifesto-80c7e3576e16) you (our community) to dig deep into your hearts and minds, to give us your best version of the Giveth Manifesto. The results did not disappoint.

The value of **community**, of the people, stands out in virtually every submission. A case to that point is the enthusiasm and passionate co-creation we witnessed in and by our own tight-knit Giveth Community, which honestly floored, wawed and awed us. To celebrate this, we are not only giving away eth to our top 3 winners (excluding jury members), [we will also dish out (comm) Points](https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a) to each and **every submission**.

We are so proud and honored to present every one of the entries here for all to see, but first things first a 🎊MAJOR CONGRATULATIONS🎊 to our winners!

Choosing the winners was not an easy process due to the fact that **every entry had gems of wisdom, sparks of insight and heartfelt candor.**

These contributions are the germination of a longer process in the coming weeks. As you might already know, transparency, accountability and especially **open-source** are key words in our vocabulary. So, practising what we preach **we will take the very best from each of these entries and use it to create a crowd-sourced manifesto**. And now _without further ado:_

**_What does Giveth stand for? What are some of the crazy things we believe in? After working with the team for +7 months now (which is years in blockchain time) these are some of the thoughts that come to mind…_**

We are a Community
------------------

> What we are doing is not about the technology. Most of us are very, very tech-minded and geeky people, and we love tech, but that is not what it is about or why we are here. It is about the people, the human connection.
>
> We live in a world that has never been more connected, but never have we felt more isolated, never have our individualistic traits and our ego been more nurtured (think social media, for one) than today. But has it made us happier? Definitely not. Even worse, it has made us retreat into ourselves, giving less, both emotionally as well as financially. Giveth wants to turn the tide, bring back the connection by building/buidling and making the World a Better Place.
>
> We are not an organization, not a DAO, we strive to be more, we are a Decentralized Altruistic Community (a DAC). Communities are based on shared values and this is what corporations and organizations lack. They do pretend to have core values, but these are outward facing, top-down and are used for branding purposes. Our values are bottom-up, crowdsourced and are the higher good that connects us.
>
> We are a community of individuals and we celebrate and respect each and everyone’s uniqueness.

We dare to be Vulnerable
------------------------

> Our main value, our essence lies in vulnerability. Most of the people at Giveth, and even in the wider ‘Maker’ blockchain space (=the opposite of daytrader land) are here because they know what ego and image brings to the world. They are professionals who have lived the corporate life and knew something was ‘off’. Hierarchy and image boosting bring pain, misunderstanding and most of all a huge waste of time and loads of inefficiency.
>
> When you dare to be vulnerable - even fragile, open and true - you can make lasting changes, because it’s the only way to truly connect with another human being. And together, when you connect, you always achieve more.
>
> Another crucial reason to open up is because ‘the system’ has trained us to be numb by providing us with all possible tools (binge-watching, medication, social media, shopping, … the list is endless). We have been trained to care less, to be less conscious of suffering and injustice, during a time where we are actually hyper-connected and thus can be hyper-informed. Knowledge brings power: sharing your thoughts, ideas and feelings can change the world. We just have to express our **outrage** and team up, because right now, as individuals, together, we actually have a bigger impact than ever before in the history of mankind.

(Please watch [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM) if you never have before)

We are Inclusive
----------------

> Everyone is welcome, we are huggers. We believe everyone has talents, has skills and can contribute to Making the World a Better Place. If you see a need in our community you should come over and get it done (see ‘We are Makers’). But even if you just want to lurk around, you should, even just you being there inspires us and we hope to inspire you.
>
> We believe in equal rights, even more, this is a given, this is no topic of discussion. No matter what gender, race, religion or political philosophy you adhere to: you are welcome, and you will be loved. Because giveth is all about community.

We advocate Abundance
---------------------

> When there is abundance people shine. Abundance is the opposite of fear and scarcity, the things that make people become protective and close-minded. We want to give people the chance to develop themselves. We want to be a spark of light, a pulsing star in this galaxy, an inspiration to others, an energy that rubs off.
>
> Only if we harness this internal energy we will be able to make real and lasting change in this world. When there is abundance people thrive and are able to not only show off their skills but their talents. The difference between skills and talents is that you no longer only do what you are good at, you do what brings happiness into your life and you bring this into the lives of others.

We are striving to be fully Decentralized
-----------------------------------------

> Money is not evil. Neither are people. But centralized power is. We are all equal with our differences. Blockchain technology, which is by its nature decentralized, is a driving force that builds and inspires our language. Language brings Culture and Culture will bring lasting change, an entirely different way to approach tensions, a new angle to think about ‘issues’.
>
> We are about the people. But we are not about just one person or a few stars, we are a Galaxy and all of us should burn brightly.

We are Humble
-------------

> You cannot be decentralized and part of a Community if you do not let go of your ego. We don’t boast. We are not interested in your words but in what you do. We let our work speak for itself and will celebrate the individuals, but most of all the community that makes dreams a reality.
>
> We like to have fun but we celebrate balance and modesty. When it comes to spending, we are transparent and accountable because it makes things easier and just, well… more honest.

We are Transparent
------------------

> Sharing is caring. We have nothing to hide. We are fully transparent, we practise what we preach, we are open-source.
>
> We communicate as much as possible, also between us, we do not hold back. We convey our tensions and our desired outcomes, but always try to do this in a very respectful way.

We are Makers
-------------

> When we see something needs to be done, we do it. As Swarm City [would say](https://press.swarm.city/niks-moet-2fd1b7682bb8), “the person who spots a problem is likely the most suited to solve it, because it is their brain that is attuned to seeing the gap between what is now, and what might be.” We don’t endlessly discuss things, this is just negative energy.
>
> Do not underestimate us. Our values might sound ‘out there’, idealistic or naive. But we are not. We underpromise and overdeliver. We are professionals, with lots of experience. We are engineers, developers, professional marketeers, business owners, … and we are here to stay.

**Giveth is constantly evolving and so should this document, in no way should we expect any document to totally encompass what it is to be a part of the Giveth community. The purpose of this document is to give people some understanding of the values shared by the members of the Giveth community, but if this document in some way limits the imagination of Giveth Community Members, it should be thrown away!**

> Giveth is a community focused on using blockchain technology to make the world a better place.
>
> Making the world a better place is a very broad mission, narrowing the scope would be a requirement for a normal organization but Giveth is not an organization it is a COMMUNITY. As long as the group of people that are working on a project that they believe can use blockchain to make the world a better place, they are a part of Giveth, if they choose to be.
>
> Giveth is radically inclusive and trusts each individual and group to practice self-reliance and self-management leaning towards collaboration whenever possible.
>
> Giveth supports human connection within its community even when classically certain actions/conversations maybe “unprofessional.” Especially in the name of FUN! Authenticity, vulnerability, candor, wholeness, and silliness are encouraged as long as they are building trust and stronger relationships.
>
> Giveth believes altruistic people can be rewarded for their good work and strives to find ways to make that feel easy and natural. People are more important than profits.
>
> **Blockchain technology:**

*   Aligns incentives around a collaborative consensus and shared values
*   Is radically inclusive
*   Rewards radical participation, “Do-ocracy” and innovation
*   Maintains a global perspective
*   Is at its best when decentralized
*   Can not be used coercively
*   Spreads via network effect
*   Balances Privacy with Transparency

> Giveth aspires to model itself after these incredible attributes of Blockchain tech.
>
> Givethers have the right to their pseudonymity but everything done under Giveth’s name is as transparent as possible, as replicable as possible, as accountable as possible and invitingly open source.
>
> Every Givether is a hero, a role model, living in service, while still embracing their own wants and needs. We courageously and humbly lead by example, knowing we have a lot to learn.
>
> Giveth is about experimentation and innovation. There is no right or wrong way to solve the issues in our world, we know this, and ask for help and advise, while still pushing a NOW! attitude with integrity and gratitude for the opportunity to change the world.

Some imagine providing housing for the ever-growing homeless and refugee populations worldwide. Others picture themselves developing a small plot of land for inner-city children to learn about gardening. Whether global or local, big or small, many of us truly want to help others.
>
> But how do we actually help? How do we go about making a real impact?
>
> If we have money available to donate to people in need, we soon discover the seemingly infinite layers of vampiric bureaucracy between our donations and the intended recipients, massively decreasing our intended impact.
>
> If we have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, we’re soon disillusioned by the major inefficiencies, lack of training and organization, misallocation of resources, and other issues that exist within hierarchically managed systems.
>
> If we have willpower and like-minded individuals and we decide to initiate our own causes, we quickly encounter regulatory roadblocks and resistance from archaic systems of centralized power, diverting our focus away from doing good and toward filling out paperwork and paying fees, if we’re allowed to proceed at all.
>
> We exhaust ourselves trying to do good through traditional channels, and the question still remains: how do we actually help? How do we go about making a real impact?
>
> When the systems available to us are inherently flawed, we stop relying upon those systems to achieve our goals. With tools and technologies hitherto nonexistent, we instead build a new platform for giving for the future.
>
> The desire to make the world a better place hasn’t changed, but the tools available to do so have. At the intersection of this drive to do good and the opportunities opened up to us through blockchain technology and decentralized governance, you’ll find a group of individuals known as Unicorns. These Unicorns are all a part of a growing, global community dedicated to changing the way we give. This decentralized altruistic community is known as Giveth.
>
> Like the Unicorns who make up Giveth, Giveth is diverse and ever-growing.

*   Giveth is both a culture and a manifestation of intent.
*   Giveth is an expression of love and the result of action and hard work.
*   Giveth is a transparent proof of decentralized governance in action.
*   Giveth is an amalgamation of altruism and the adjacent possible.
*   Giveth is a global community and a gift to the world.
*   Giveth is open, welcoming, and ready to support you in making the world a better place.

> If you have money available to donate to people in need, you can watch its transmittance across the world on an open ledger to assure it actually gets to those who need it. With the tools and technologies available to us, there’s no more bureaucracy to siphon off funds along the way to the recipients. Giveth doesn’t even take a cut — it doesn’t need to — it’s funded through the same process as the project you just donated to.
>
> If you have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, you’ll find the Giveth platform maximizes the efficiency and impact of the work you do with clearly defined milestones and the minimal number of actors needed to accomplish the goal. Transparency and accountability are built in, so your work is both noticed and supported by your fellow Unicorns as well as the donors themselves.
>
> If you have willpower and like-minded individuals and you decide to initiate your own causes, you’ll discover an easy-to-use toolset that enables you to create a project with the same ease as creating a blog post. You’ll immediately be able to start receiving donations and create clear steps to achieving your ultimate outcome with no red-tape or fees of any kind.
>
> The best part about Giveth is that anybody can join the community and contribute to making the world a better place. If you’re a human being living on planet Earth and you want to do good, we are your people, and this is your opportunity to make a real impact. Make your mark and add your name to the growing community of Unicorns from around the world by joining us on this magnificent journey to building the future of giving!

The Giveth Manifesto is a statement of principles, of purpose and of determination.
===================================================================================

> We are **determined** to accomplish our **purpose** to make a better world through **decentralization, technology and the power of communities**.
>
> We believe communities are evolving organizations (call them flocks, swarms, galaxies or as you may) that are flexible, stronger than the individual and built by such individuals in order to accomplish a purpose.
>
> We believe the Giveth Unicorns, the members of the Giveth Galaxy, are people and not cogs in a machine, that find resonance between Giveth’s purpose and their own purpose. Our Galaxy is universal and radically inclusive and able to accommodate everyone that wants to contribute to its goal. We experiment with Governance to unleash everyone’s potential and ability to play a part.
>
> We believe in **openness, transparency and accountability**: we apply these concepts internally and work towards facilitating other communities externally thanks to our outputs by the [DApp Development Circle](https://medium.com/giveth/tagged/dappening), as well as contributing to other projects guided by the same principles through our [Social Coding Circle](https://medium.com/giveth/tagged/socialcoding).
>
> We believe blockchain technology is a powerful tool to design systems that incentivize the creation of communities that transcend the chain -or Decentralized Altruistic Communities- where all stakeholders, including but not limited to Makers, Donors and recipients, can be upfront about their needs and expectations in an environment of trust and collaboration. We believe we can help build these systems and transform how the non-profit sector has traditionally worked.
>
> We want to make **a better future by building the tools** for any community to push their vision of a better, decentralized world.
>
> We are determined to succeed. We are the Giveth Unicorns. We and you. A better future for all.

Humanity vs. The Problems of the World
======================================

> **Why do we have the problems we do,** like global warming, homelessness, and environmental destruction?
>
> **It’s not because we lack the capacity to fix it**. For any problem, there’s an array of experts who have a plan of action to tackle it.
>
> **It’s not because we lack the capital**. There’s more money in the world than ever before.
>
> **What we lack is an effective system for organizing and incentivizing people to tackle the problems that are not profitable to solve.**
>
> [Giveth](https://giveth.io/) is that system — a platform for unleashing the human spirit to conquer the problems of our world. Giveth enables those who want to do good in the world to trustlessly collaborate with those who want to fund that work. Funds are paid only when the work happens. All actions are transparently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Giveth is the lightest possible framework for allowing strangers to effect change together.
>
> The Giveth Unicorns are the group of people building Giveth. We have different backgrounds, skill sets, and countries of residence; but we’re united by a shared vision:
>
> We believe that every human being should be able to get funding to make the world a better place.
>
> We believe that every human being should be able to transparently see their funds create good in the world.
>
> We believe that our problems are too large for any individual to solve, and so we need the power of communities.
>
> We believe that transparency is the key to staying focused on the work at hand.
>
> We believe a better world is possible if we effectively unite the minds, funds, and time of everyone who cares about the same issues.
>
> Are you one of those magical creatures — a _Unicorn_ — who believes our problems are solvable through collaboration, aligned incentives, and a little ETH? Giveth will be better with your contributions. [Come create Giveth with us.](https://giveth.io/join/)

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Giveth is a decentralized community of collaborators around the cause of making the world a better place. We are the Giveth Galaxy that empowers communities to achieve their mission. Giveth’s actions are guided by following principles:**

Radical Openness and Transparency:
==================================

> Any project, git repository, presentation or document that has been made within Giveth shall be publicly accessible and usable. We pledge to share these transparently in an organized fashion and provide all necessary guidance. In this sense we identify ourselves with the GNU principles.

Inclusiveness
-------------

> To Giveth there is only one race -the human race-, no sex, no religion, no disability nor political affiliation. Everyone is welcome and we encourage you to share your view and enrich our community.

Independence
------------

> We are financed through unconditional donations that will be used to build, support, evolve and maintain our products, contributors and community. As a group of individuals we pledge to be neutral and any affiliation or promotion of other projects, political parties or movements shall be discussed and agreed by the majority of our community through our internal governance organs. Any such decision shall be publicly shared and be accessible as long as Giveth exists. You can not buy Giveth.

Accountability
--------------

> We see Giveth as a gift to humanity. As such we are accountable to our donors, contributors and the whole of humanity that we will do our best to build Giveth with the resources given and according to our abilities. We assume the responsibility of accounting for our actions as a movement.

Voice of change
---------------

> We are not blind nor silent. When we witness acts of violence, bullying or oppression we may speak out publicly as individuals or as a group. Any such action is not welcome in our own community and will be dealt with.

What Giveth.io Means to Me
==========================

> Giveth is a very special altruistic offering of distributed software and grouping of rare unicorns. At its core Giveth enables communities to form around the causes that matter to them the most. On a personal level Giveth is the reason I shifted my vision from only seeing fungible stores of value loosely referred to as ‘crypto’ and decided to dedicate my corporeal energy to enabling trust within this space. A bit about me is in order first however.
>
> I came to ‘crypto’ not as a newbie but someone who was well versed in utilizing cryptographic hashes and technology within daily operations. My first introduction to personal computers came in 1986 when my family moved to Houston TX, and I would play games like ‘Wheel of Fortune’ , ‘Ninja Gaiden’, and ‘SpiderMan’ on our IBM 8086. My first tech job came at the age of 17 where I taught children QBASIC, html, and audio processing at the ‘American Computer Experience’ summer camps. Fast forward to 2009 and my technolust was immediately sparked by this thing I caught wind of called Bitcoin. I had no position in the market other than watching the price of BTC go from near nothing to over $10 USD/BTC.
>
> In August of 2017 life dealt me two perspective altering situations within a week: Hurricane Harvey and losing my job as a Corporate Security Analyst of 5 years. The loss of my position was heartbreaking but being surrounded by constant destruction brought on by an “800 year flood” kept me sane and sober. By December life had begun to return back to normal for most of us Houstonian’s, however something incredible was taking place with the price of Bitcoin: it was over $10,000/BTC!
>
> The dramatic increase of volume plus pricing momentum within Bitcoin caused me to study value theory and seriously contemplate just wtf was going on. Whether it was serendipity, fate, or just plain dumb luck I discovered Giveth via a [youtube presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iShzx6iqwus&index=15&list=PLIR2KLUqBsWnbhDZKi0S43Q5PnxFGdiEo) from Griff Green at the Ethereum Community Conference 2018. At this point all of my attention shifted studying pricing and volatility to determining how to best distribute trust.
>
> Giveth will play a key role in enabling communities to distribute trust via decentralized governance. At a high level, Giveth can be viewed as software that enables communities to form causes and promote those causes via group determined milestones. Individuals who are part of a given community can spawn their own milestones, and via pledging of ETH to those milestones prioritize what is and is not important for that community with 100% transparency. Additionally those who give within this structure can be notified when their milestone is reached as well as delegate authority of their contribution to others within their community.
>
> Giveth is not an ICO, a corporation, or a monolithic organization that promises to render aid while capturing the majority of users contributions in times of need (most charities). Giveth is an opportunity to do better by humanity via distributed trust within systems of decentralized governance that \*anyone\* can run.

> **“You can’t go around building a better world for people. Only people can build a better world. Otherwise it’s just a cage.” — Terry Pratchett**

> If you want to understand what Giveth values are and what it means to be a Unicorn and to be part of the Giveth community, you has to understand that the simple goal of all Unicorns in the Giveth galaxy, all around the world is, to make the world a better place.
>
> This starts with the fact that Giveth trusts in people, real, actual people.
>
> Let me explain why this is an amazing, outstanding fact in 2018. We spend the last years and maybe generation with the trust in the big systems and cooperations. The (centralized) banking system, centralized political systems with so called “representatives of the people” who rule countries and do not even know any longer what is going on in a country, the idea that the fact that we are allowed to go to vote every 4 (or 5 years) is all it needs for a democracy to work. We trusted in this centralized systems to rule the world and sort out our human problems. What we end up with was a banking crisis, plastic rubbish all over the planet, a so called refugee crisis and more and more the distrust in systems. We trust in charity organizations all over the world to sort out what we humans fucked up in the past and wonder in the end that we do not know what happened with the donations that we made. We trusted in system for a long time, until we realized that this systems are not working out the way we wanted. We realized that no one will sort out all the rubbish in the oceans and at the beaches if we do not start doing it ourselves, more and more people realize that we need to take our power as citizens back to actually have a say in a democracy, we start to realize that it makes sense to have a reliable person we can trust instead of a bank. We start to realize that centralized systems do not work out the way we though. Decentralization and the trust in people, actually people are two of the main values of Giveth. All these people, all over the world, who contribute their love and time, their work and ideas into Giveth are Unicorns. People with ideas who want to be part of the movement to change the world and make it a better place are Unicorns.
>
> Giveth wants to give power back to people while decentralizing systems. One of Giveths goals and values is to make a donation system transparent, complete and absolute. We want to make donations transparent, direct and reliable. And even if Giveth is a charity organization, we are not just talking about donations. We are talking about the structure of governance within the organization, about reliable, accountable people within the Giveth galaxy, about the fact that everyone and anyone can actively participate in the platform, the organization and the idea of Giveth. The future of giving is not just giving ether to a cause that needs support. Giving can of course be monetary but can also be work force, bodys, love, time, minds and ideas for the greater good.
>
> A lot of people already volunteer for a good cause, give time and love to a project or an idea. Giveth is on the way to build a platform that allows any one of us to make a real change in our community, our neighborhood. I will be able to put up a cause that is important in my direct neighborhood and will make a change and a direct impact in my community — and you can too. Because, you not what? No one knows better what’s going on in your neighborhood than you. Why should anyone donate money to a big, intransparent organization that pays CEO’s instead of directly to your cause? Your community wants to teach kids how to code, you want to feed the homeless people, you want to gather a couple of people and pick up all the rubbish at your local beach/town/park? Cool, put up a cause on the Giveth platform and start to do so. Giveth believes and trusts in people and in you. This is the highest value any organization can have: the trust in people.
>
> Shaping the future needs more than just a couple of people, it needs all of us, the human community. So we are calling everyone, to become a Unicorn and join us in the movement to #maketheworldabtterplace.

> _“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,_ [_we were all going direct the other way”_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities)

**_–_ in short the Unicorns were getting easier and easier to spot as they were coming together to reinvent the most fundamental thing there is.**

> **Giveth is reinventing what it means to be human.**
>
> Humans are not the only life form which create but we have made it our ultimate evolutionary skill. To create is to give and vice versa. Giving is the most primal expression of creating, the most basic level. To voluntarily give something that is yours ( mind, body, property…) by leaving your ownership it becomes something for somebody else. In other words : something changed, transformed, got created.
>
> So giving, What’s so special about that? Everybody does it in one way or another. But the giving the Unicorns are talking about is voluntarily or coercion-free! This means no one can force you in any way. Nor are there gatekeepers who have the power to interfere in the process of you giving. The Giveth Unicorns credo is very clear :
>
> • Donating can be simple, fun and effective.
>
> • Transparency and accountability can be the default.
>
> • Every idea has the potential to make a positive impact, and it can be heard and funded in a decentralized fashion.
>
> • Every Donor can have the ultimate say over how their donation is used.
>
> • People that want to do good work for their cause can be rewarded for their actions.
>
> • Real change and innovation comes about when communities join together to make the world a better place.
>
> Unicorns have always been elusive creatures but now the stars in the Giveth Galaxy have aligned and they are popping up everywhere. Everywhere people are noticing what is being built, being reinvented and want to contribute. The moment you give your time, your energy, your love to this community and project, and help in some way in its existence, a new Unicorn is born.
>
> Permissionless creation will make us unstoppable. It gives hope for the future and the confidence that there will always be people who act for the good of others and that they will succeed.

> There are restrictive walls that contain possibility. Inside these walls passion and motivation are strangled by bureaucracy, limitations, and unrelated political tethers. Giveth breaks down these walls and exposes possibility to the wide open expanse contained only by the one natural restriction, capacity. Giveth is where possibility meets capacity, where, passion and motivation are free to flourish and where only nature itself can restrain us.
>
> Those with the passion to change the world sit on one side of a vast and long continent, on the other side are those who want to help them and have the resources to make their vision possible. Giveth is a canal right through the middle of that continent, removing the need to go all the way around and convincing more and more people on both sides to make the journey from the world we live in to the world we believe in.

*   Giveth is a decentralized platform that facilitates better giving and better receiving, contributing to creating a better world
*   Giveth creates increased transparency and allows results based giving for individual donors, in turn inspiring creation of more and more givers and more and more change makers
*   Giveth believes in connecting change makers with those who want to support their mission, allowing them to avoid the mission creep that comes with chasing semi-related funding
*   Giveth believes in decentralized, democratic, liquid control of donor funds
*   Giveth believes in maximizing each gifts potential, utilizing blockchain technology to decrease administrative cost requirements
*   Giveth believes in giving change makers the funds and trust they need to make the change they want to see a reality

> Unicorns, previously thought of as being as elusive as they are mysterious and wondrous are in actuality easier to see than one would think and you even possess what it takes to be one. With transparency at the height of their values, however, they are just as easily looked past as they are open with their ability to share and positively impact their world. Hiding in the plain sight of the blockchain forests, these Unicorns believe in a simplicity that allow the moving parts of the world they believe in to glide seamlessly together without the need of a centralized force to guide them. They hope to give the power over sharing and donation out to the very people participating in order to stimulate a positive change of attitude and integrity for the **Decentralized Altruistic Communities** that they are a part of. By using this value system based on participation, innovation, transparency, and accountability the Giveth Unicorns hope to use smart contracts to put donors in charge of how their funds are used, they hope to allow that direct relationship to create a rewarding system for all who are involved so that positivity is felt at the very core of each donation. Giveth Unicorns know that sharing should feel good and that goodness has the ability to shift attitudes of the world for the better, for a more common force toward one another acting accountable and responsible for what they are putting out into the place we’re all a part of.

> Dear Galaxy,
>
> If you’re reading this we’ve done it, all the work the Unicorn troopers fought for was not in vain.
>
> **The mission we set out to accomplish was clear:**
>
> _Create a trustless system of self governing bodies, capable of uniting around causes they choose to support._
>
> _Build a platform that fosters experimentation, collaboration and open source initiatives._
>
> _Awaken the Giver within all the citizen of this Galaxy and beyond, by showing them how and where their contributions make a difference._
>
> The Centralization forces were determined to keep the Galaxy under their control, well we couldn’t let that happen, not for our sake and the sake of generations to come.
>
> To accomplish our mission we had to do something greater than simply unseating the unjust forces.
>
> We had to show them a better way!
>
> **The way of the Unicorn.**
>
> We started a battle that will never end, the fight for truth, justice and transparency between citizens and powers is one that must live on forever.
>
> It’s up to you to keep this fight alive all throughout your Galaxy, to inspire, incite and expose the truth for all to see.
>
> This was the cause we chose to fight for, the one we believed mattered most to our generation.
>
> Now it’s your turn to decide, what will you fight for?
>
> We’ve given you the tools to sculpt your future, to build your community and free yourselves.
>
> Use them wisely and never, EVER…… **Forget!**

**Urban dictionary explains a unicorn as: The rare creature who is able to give you the thing you always wanted but thought you you could never have.**

> I feel that is at of the heart of Giveth. So many people from all over the globe are coming together to build a tool that will change the future in ways we thought we could never could; creating impact that was impossible not long ago.
>
> We see past borders, languages and currencies and are building a new way of helping each other without any of these traditional obstacles.
