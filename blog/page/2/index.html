They aren‚Äôt. Self-managed organizations exist all over the world, but there is no template for how a decentralized self-managed organization should work. Let us try to change that.</em></p><p>Self-managed organizations (those without a management middlemen layer and hierarchy) have to overcome a lot of hurdles when it comes to governance. For example, on one side, the direction of the organization cannot be dictated top-down by management and on the other side nobody can push responsibility up and ‚Äújust do what they are told‚Äù.</p><p>These hurdles, Frederic Laloux, author of ‚Äú<a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinventing Organizations</a>‚Äù suggests, exist mainly because traditional management practices and traditionally managed organizations are so prevalent that we have a lack of examples to follow. In other words, we might have never seen better! Moreover, there have been years and years of organizational research and practice on hierarchical structures (think both about an old-age tribe with a clear, visible head and also a large corporation with a twitter rant-prone CEO).</p><p>On top of that, we have new models of governance arising within blockchain structures or enabled by blockchain solutions (<a href="https://medium.com/@leo_pold_b/blockchain-governance-takeaways-from-nine-projects-8a80ad214d15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here‚Äôs</a> a pretty good article that touches on some of the key points), although there is not so much literature on specifically non-hierarchical, egalitarian structures.</p><p>While there are great companies pushing the envelope in both blockchain governance and self-management, it‚Äôs time for us to investigate, explore and document different forms of non-hierarchical governance for organizations. Giveth‚Äôs Governance Circle, and particularly <a href="https://twitter.com/Loie_Low" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loie</a>, whose goal is to foster governance experiments, is launching the Unicorn DAC on that regard. Lorelei devoted countless hours to ideate, iterate and bring to life this project with the rest of the Unicorns‚Ä¶ and this is the result.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="stepping-up-the-game"></a>Stepping up the game<a class="hash-link" href="#stepping-up-the-game" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Operationally, Giveth works much like a swarm. Around a strong core of main contributors, collaborators that are aligned with the purpose of Giveth come and go and offer their time, ideas and work. Some of these collaborators do one assignment and leave and others stay collaborating on the periphery but for the longest time. They are rewarded through a mechanism called <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RewardDAO</a>, with which everyone can get points that then can be exchanged for ether if they upload a video on our <a href="https://fame.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall of Fame</a> or to the <a href="https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3d9746329bc64ae74d1424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp itself</a>.</p><p>But these points are awarded somewhat arbitrarily and there‚Äôs a limited amount of monthly ether that goes to fund these rewards. Hence, the amount that collaborators receive in ether can vary depending on other people‚Äôs contributions and points. We think it‚Äôs a great introductory system for getting into the Giveth Galaxy, but might not be ideal as a fully decentralized non-hierarchical governance model. In fact, it‚Äôs not really a complete governance model, as it doesn‚Äôt necessarily steer Giveth‚Äôs big decisions, but our experience tells us that it does motivate people to take initiative, talk to the most committed contributors and suggest new projects and initiatives.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="put-your-money-where-your-purpose-is"></a><strong>Put your money where your purpose is</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#put-your-money-where-your-purpose-is" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To be clear, governance in self-managed organizations boils down to who decides ‚Äî and how it is decided ‚Äî what the organization dedicates its resources to?</p><p>So in the case of Giveth, the question was: How could we empower everyone that is fully committed to Giveth to decide what actions and what strategic direction should the organization take? And even further, could we do that in a way that we leverage our own products, i.e. the Giveth DApp? -we do like our #dogfooding!</p><p>Well, the Giveth DApp allows Makers to create <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DACs, Campaigns and Milestones</a>, and Givers to fund whatever change they want to see realized in the world. Could we not create a DAC that Unicorns can use to propose projects through Milestones, and other Unicorns can fund them if they think they are aligned with Giveth‚Äôs purpose? We would distribute money to our Unicorns ‚Äî this group of core contributors ‚Äî and they could fund any Milestone they wanted.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What better way to steer an organization than by democratizing both the access to resources and the power to propose actions and then let everyone actually put resources where the Giveth purpose lies the strongest?</strong></p></blockquote><p>Sometimes Unicorns will decide to fund already existing Milestones, and sometimes they will create a new bounty. This gives everyone the power to suggest a project, give it a price tag, and if the funding target gets reached, empower and pay this person to make it happen. If it doesn‚Äôt get funded, it would mean that the project was possibly not so aligned with the general feeling and purpose anyway.</p><p><strong>Examples of funded proposals:</strong></p><p>a) Lorelei is often frustrated by the lack of sharing info in the Ethereum community. Everybody seems to be having the same conversations but no one is hearing each other. When she hears about Tennagraph, the community signaling aggregator to answer just this need, she becomes very passionate about it and decides to use her Unicorn DAC delegation allowance to fund Deam to go to Web3 Summit and raise awareness and adoption for Tennagraph!</p><p>b) Lanski has identified a feature for our <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp</a> that a bunch of Makers would like to have in the platform. It might not seem it‚Äôs a priority from a technical point of view, but as a matter of fact, all the feedback that he is receiving from the users mentions that particular need. He assesses the cost with the DApp team and creates a Milestone where they (the DApp team) are the beneficiary. The work, though, is too expensive and he cannot pay it on his own, but Lorelei realizes how important the feature is and funds the Milestone too so the DApp team can go ahead and build it to claim the Milestone.</p><p><strong>Example of an unsuccessful proposal:</strong></p><p>Lanski wants to make stickers of Giveth‚Äôs logo to stick all over the world ‚Äî for marketing purposes. Everyone has got some stickers left from the last batch, but not enough to cover half of the world with them, so he wants to make MORE. But the general consensus is that we are publicizing well and doing the right outreach in the circles that we want to attract at this stage, so nobody actually funds the Milestone. Sorry Lanski, maybe later when we decide to do a publicity campaign for the general public!</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ins-and-outs-of-the-unicorn-dac"></a><strong>Ins and outs of the Unicorn DAC</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#ins-and-outs-of-the-unicorn-dac" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This Governance experiment is precisely that, an experiment. And the initial parameters are sort of arbitrarily defined and will be polished as we go along.</p><ol><li>We‚Äôve been a community gathered around shared principles and purpose for a while now, but never had an official onboarding process because there‚Äôs no clear entity to be onboarded to. Now, we have the opportunity to come together around these agreements and create a membrane that gathers and recognizes the most committed of us as we join the Unicorn DAC. You can read about our Onboarding Process <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/unicorn-dac/unicorn-onboarding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, which ensures commitment to Giveth‚Äôs purpose and alignment with our principles in order to opt to be part of the DAC.</li><li>The resource allowance per head will be the equivalent in ether to 600 USD every week. In order for people not to fund only their own Milestones, we have capped the amount people can put into their own Milestones at 150 USD, so 450 will be used to decide on other people‚Äôs initiatives. Unicorns don‚Äôt have to use the full 600 USD every week if they feel that there are no interesting projects to fund, or the ones that are truly interesting are already fully funded.</li><li>Needless to say, people can choose NOT to fund any of their own Milestones. The reason why we allow people to self-fund their Milestones for a certain amount is to facilitate the funding of menial or uninteresting jobs that have to be done, but they would waste people‚Äôs time and resources if they had to be reviewed and funded by other unicorns.</li><li>We cannot expect people to feel connected to a purpose by only chipping money into Milestones. Hence, in order to keep purpose alive, we have a once a month Unicorn Meeting! Here, we discuss which projects we delegated to and why it is aligned to Giveth.</li><li>As a rule of thumb, Milestones will be created by those who hold roles related to the matter at hand. That‚Äôs not to say that people can‚Äôt have great ideas outside of their roles, but they should follow the <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/advice-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advice process</a> and certainly consult with those who hold relevant roles before taking action, even if it is merely for keeping information flows going. Roles are evaluated on how well they have been fulfilled in a peer review system every month.</li></ol><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="mvping-our-way-through-it"></a><strong>MVPing our way through it</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#mvping-our-way-through-it" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We are ready to try the Unicorn DAC and carve our own way in decentralized governance practices. As the experiment that it is, we do expect some issues to come up, and we have already identified a few:</p><ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dogfooding</a> is our motto because we believe the Giveth DApp is a great tool. Nevertheless, it does not yet have the advanced functionalities of a compounded delegation system that would allow you to allocate only up to a percentage of funds into your own Milestones and the rest to others. We will track donations manually at this point while we look for a solution, be it homemade or leveraging <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a>.</li><li>Foreign influence. Our DAC will always be public, transparent and held to the highest standards, but the fact that it‚Äôs an open way to fund the projects that Giveth undertakes, it could be exposed to an admittedly unlikely vector of attack where a powerful party decides to fund specific Milestones or projects that are on the periphery of the purpose and this acts in detriment of the best direction to take. This would be a similar attack to sovereignty to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893815001003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMF dictating policies to countries</a> in exchange for bailouts or access to concessional loans.</li><li>That said, we have funds to support this initiative for a limited period of time, and since Giveth is a non-profit blockchain entity that accepts donations, if you are a donor and <strong>want to support Blockchain4Good projects PLUS a decentralized non-hierarchical governance experiment like the Unicorn DAC</strong>, we are all ears (and eyes!): hit us up on <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Riot</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> or fund us <a href="https://giveth.io/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly</a>!</li></ol><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="already-winning"></a><strong>Already winning</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#already-winning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The Unicorn DAC was presented during DevCon4 at the <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/devcon4-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon Dream DAO contest</a>‚Ä¶ and it won the runner-up prize! 250 ANT + 250 DAI for making it a reality!

Gone are the days where you could work 30 years at a company, then get a fancy watch and a golden handshake into retirement. The industrial revolution of the early 1800‚Äôs brought more people out of the country and into factories and workshops, attracted by better pay.</p><p>And while offices were growing in number back then, it wasn‚Äôt until the 20th century that office culture became a mainstream phenomenon. Now with the arrival of the internet and, more recently, blockchain we are seeing another shift in the way people work.</p><p>At <a href="https://medium.com/bounties-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Bounties Network</strong></a> and <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-social-coding:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Giveth Social Coding</strong></a> we decided to collaborate on this topic. So we recently posed and posted a question about The Future of Work:</p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúIf you love your employees let them go, to Thailand, to school, to a sabbatical where ever they might choose. The constraints placed on us today in the working economy are unreasonable and completely unconducive to personal growth, truth, happiness and workplace fulfilment.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote><p>Today we‚Äôre going to integrate some of the responses from <a href="https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/1641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>that post</strong></a> to get a better idea of how the future of work may look like.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="location-location-location"></a>Location, Location, Location<a class="hash-link" href="#location-location-location" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>The company of the future is no longer bound by company walls or even country borders for that matter. Employers are starting to understand that sourcing the best talent at the right price is more important than where they are located. Poster <strong>Jose Aguinaga</strong> highlights this about his international company:</p><blockquote><p><em>In our company, we are roughly 15+ employees/designers all over the world. We have people from Mexico City to New Zealand, in Vancouver and Sofia. We started in Switzerland, and have embraced a decentralized workspace from day 1.</em></p></blockquote><p>Many jobs these days only require a laptop and a good internet connection</p><p>The internet ushered in the digital economy and a huge percentage of job postings these days are looking for digital skills. The obvious benefit of this is that you can work remotely just about anywhere you have a computer and a decent internet connection.</p><p>Jose goes on to explain, however, that remote working is not for everybody. It requires discipline, flexibility, and a sense of responsibility that may not suit everyone‚Äôs personality. Some workers are just not cut out for that kind of independence. To be clear, many jobs still require us to be in the same space. But in the future, we will be able to solve many of the problems that come with trying to cram so many people into big cities.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="working-in-tune-with-your-own-rhythms"></a>Working in Tune with Your Own Rhythms<a class="hash-link" href="#working-in-tune-with-your-own-rhythms" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Let‚Äôs expand on that a bit. As many of you will know, working a 9‚Äì5 job in a major city can be a real headache. With worldwide populations continuing to grow, it‚Äôs not unheard of to hear people spend 2‚Äì3 hours every day commuting to work. But now many companies are starting to wake up to the fact that many tasks are not time-specific. Do you really need to be in the office at 9 to respond to client emails for an hour?</p><p>In addition, employees are not robots (most anyway) and do not function with on/off switches. Every worker is unique and possesses strengths and weaknesses. People produce their best work at various times of the day. User <strong>Brad</strong> highlighted this in his post with the following words:</p><blockquote><p><em>It has been repeatedly shown that creative and intelligent minds are more likely to be night owls, and unlikely to stay tied down to one place for long periods of time.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now whether or not that fits your profile is irrelevant. Some people love the early morning hours and take the afternoon off. Some work perfectly in the 9‚Äì5 structure. Others, as Brad suggests, work well into the night when the peace and quiet provide plenty of opportunities to get work done.</p><p>To add to that, most workers would agree that one of the most important aspects of a job is a healthy working environment. Happy employees are productive workers. Poster <strong>Bount_Hunter</strong> highlights this well in his/her post:</p><blockquote><p><em>If the person you want to do X job for you is happier to be doing it a 8pm -4 am in Malaysia vs 9‚Äì5 in chicago their work will always be better. We‚Äôve all worked jobs we HATE (i‚Äôm currently doing that now) and you don‚Äôt get the best work from people who are working jobs they don‚Äôt like.</em></p></blockquote><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="decentralized-autonomous-organizations"></a>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations<a class="hash-link" href="#decentralized-autonomous-organizations" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>It should come as no surprise then that decentralized organizations are springing up everywhere. And blockchain is pioneering this effort with projects dedicated to making that kind of a future a reality. Take <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Aragon</strong></a> for example, a project aimed at breaking down traditional borders and intermediaries.</p><p>In the modern world, much of the existing business value is captured by those at the top of the pyramid. It‚Äôs a little sad then that many of the people creating that value don‚Äôt actually get rewarded for doing so. The workplace of tomorrow will flatten these management structures and allow the value to be distributed more evenly.</p><p>Take this very article for example. It was crowd-sourced and funded from contributors around the world using a decentralized application. What could be more empowering than allowing employees to have an active stake and say in the company and process from the get-go?</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="closing-thoughts-the-future-of-work"></a>Closing Thoughts: The Future of Work<a class="hash-link" href="#closing-thoughts-the-future-of-work" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>It‚Äôs sometimes hard to see a change in the future of work since we‚Äôve been following a centralized hierarchical office model for many years now. The only thing we can be certain of is change. Those that embrace it are usually the ones who reap the most rewards in the new economy.</p><p>Finally, to highlight the real-life change we are facing as work evolves, let me tell you a little about my own history. I am a South African who is dating a German who lives in the Netherlands. My mother is Italian and I work part-time for an American company. Borders are completely artificial constructions of man. The human spirit doesn‚Äôt want to be tied down by the rules of a few men sitting in an office somewhere. The future of work is exciting.

And together, when you connect, you always achieve more.</p><p>Another crucial reason to open up is because ‚Äòthe system‚Äô has trained us to be numb by providing us with all possible tools (binge-watching, medication, social media, shopping, ‚Ä¶ the list is endless). We have been trained to care less, to be less conscious of suffering and injustice, during a time where we are actually hyper-connected and thus can be hyper-informed.

With tools and technologies hitherto nonexistent, we instead build a new platform for giving for the future.</p><p>The desire to make the world a better place hasn‚Äôt changed, but the tools available to do so have. At the intersection of this drive to do good and the opportunities opened up to us through blockchain technology and decentralized governance, you‚Äôll find a group of individuals known as Unicorns. These Unicorns are all a part of a growing, global community dedicated to changing the way we give. This decentralized altruistic community is known as Giveth.</p><p>Like the Unicorns who make up Giveth, Giveth is diverse and ever-growing.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Giveth is both a culture and a manifestation of intent.</li><li>Giveth is an expression of love and the result of action and hard work.</li><li>Giveth is a transparent proof of decentralized governance in action.</li><li>Giveth is an amalgamation of altruism and the adjacent possible.</li><li>Giveth is a global community and a gift to the world.</li><li>Giveth is open, welcoming, and ready to support you in making the world a better place.</li></ul><blockquote><p>If you have money available to donate to people in need, you can watch its transmittance across the world on an open ledger to assure it actually gets to those who need it. With the tools and technologies available to us, there‚Äôs no more bureaucracy to siphon off funds along the way to the recipients. Giveth doesn‚Äôt even take a cut ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äî it‚Äôs funded through the same process as the project you just donated to.</p><p>If you have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, you‚Äôll find the Giveth platform maximizes the efficiency and impact of the work you do with clearly defined milestones and the minimal number of actors needed to accomplish the goal. Transparency and accountability are built in, so your work is both noticed and supported by your fellow Unicorns as well as the donors themselves.</p><p>If you have willpower and like-minded individuals and you decide to initiate your own causes, you‚Äôll discover an easy-to-use toolset that enables you to create a project with the same ease as creating a blog post. You‚Äôll immediately be able to start receiving donations and create clear steps to achieving your ultimate outcome with no red-tape or fees of any kind.</p><p>The best part about Giveth is that anybody can join the community and contribute to making the world a better place. If you‚Äôre a human being living on planet Earth and you want to do good, we are your people, and this is your opportunity to make a real impact. Make your mark and add your name to the growing community of Unicorns from around the world by joining us on this magnificent journey to building the future of giving!</p><p><strong>With A Love That Echoes Throughout The Galaxy</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/b60aa9f7ce4d?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Joshua Du Chene</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>üîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆüîÆ</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-life-of-the-giveth-unicorn"></a>The life of the Giveth Unicorn<a class="hash-link" href="#the-life-of-the-giveth-unicorn" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><blockquote><p>Giveth Unicorns may come and go.

At its core Giveth enables communities to form around the causes that matter to them the most. On a personal level Giveth is the reason I shifted my vision from only seeing fungible stores of value loosely referred to as ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô and decided to dedicate my corporeal energy to enabling trust within this space. A bit about me is in order first however.</p><p>I came to ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô not as a newbie but someone who was well versed in utilizing cryptographic hashes and technology within daily operations. My first introduction to personal computers came in 1986 when my family moved to Houston TX, and I would play games like ‚ÄòWheel of Fortune‚Äô , ‚ÄòNinja Gaiden‚Äô, and ‚ÄòSpiderMan‚Äô on our IBM 8086. My first tech job came at the age of 17 where I taught children QBASIC, html, and audio processing at the ‚ÄòAmerican Computer Experience‚Äô summer camps. Fast forward to 2009 and my technolust was immediately sparked by this thing I caught wind of called Bitcoin. I had no position in the market other than watching the price of BTC go from near nothing to over $10 USD/BTC.</p><p>In August of 2017 life dealt me two perspective altering situations within a week: Hurricane Harvey and losing my job as a Corporate Security Analyst of 5 years. The loss of my position was heartbreaking but being surrounded by constant destruction brought on by an ‚Äú800 year flood‚Äù kept me sane and sober. By December life had begun to return back to normal for most of us Houstonian‚Äôs, however something incredible was taking place with the price of Bitcoin: it was over $10,000/BTC!</p><p>The dramatic increase of volume plus pricing momentum within Bitcoin caused me to study value theory and seriously contemplate just wtf was going on. Whether it was serendipity, fate, or just plain dumb luck I discovered Giveth via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iShzx6iqwus&amp;index=15&amp;list=PLIR2KLUqBsWnbhDZKi0S43Q5PnxFGdiEo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube presentation</a> from Griff Green at the Ethereum Community Conference 2018. At this point all of my attention shifted studying pricing and volatility to determining how to best distribute trust.</p><p>Giveth will play a key role in enabling communities to distribute trust via decentralized governance. At a high level, Giveth can be viewed as software that enables communities to form causes and promote those causes via group determined milestones. Individuals who are part of a given community can spawn their own milestones, and via pledging of ETH to those milestones prioritize what is and is not important for that community with 100% transparency. Additionally those who give within this structure can be notified when their milestone is reached as well as delegate authority of their contribution to others within their community.</p><p>Giveth is not an ICO, a corporation, or a monolithic organization that promises to render aid while capturing the majority of users contributions in times of need (most charities). Giveth is an opportunity to do better by humanity via distributed trust within systems of decentralized governance that *anyone* can run.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/40f75102c422?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Meefs</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©üé©</p><blockquote><p>~DAppLion</p></blockquote><p>üéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéßüéß</p><p><strong>Why Giveth?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We believe in the power of communities to solve problems.</p><p>We believe in decentralized technology to unleash the creativity and energy of altruistic communities.</p><p>Giving is a humanitarian act of solidarity and empathy ‚Äî we believe in the fundamental rights and dignity of every human being.</p><p>We are doing nothing less than reinventing giving!</p></blockquote><p><strong>What?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We build a platform for trust and transparency in giving.</p><p>Decentralized altruistic communities promote social innovation and create opportunities for people.</p><p>This platform is in strong contrast to the systems currently in place: bureaucratic, inflexible, centralized, with a lot of overhead</p></blockquote><p><strong>How?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We are enthusiastic and passionate ‚Äî we do a hell of a lot of amazing stuff.</p><p>We are a community ‚Äî open, transparent, cooperative, companionable and focused to deliver.</p><p>We are an active part of the Ethereum eco-system and contribute to the development of Ethereum.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Ron Mat</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è</p><blockquote><p><strong>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go around building a better world for people.

We spend the last years and maybe generation with the trust in the big systems and cooperations. The (centralized) banking system, centralized political systems with so called ‚Äúrepresentatives of the people‚Äù who rule countries and do not even know any longer what is going on in a country, the idea that the fact that we are allowed to go to vote every 4 (or 5 years) is all it needs for a democracy to work. We trusted in this centralized systems to rule the world and sort out our human problems. What we end up with was a banking crisis, plastic rubbish all over the planet, a so called refugee crisis and more and more the distrust in systems. We trust in charity organizations all over the world to sort out what we humans fucked up in the past and wonder in the end that we do not know what happened with the donations that we made. We trusted in system for a long time, until we realized that this systems are not working out the way we wanted. We realized that no one will sort out all the rubbish in the oceans and at the beaches if we do not start doing it ourselves, more and more people realize that we need to take our power as citizens back to actually have a say in a democracy, we start to realize that it makes sense to have a reliable person we can trust instead of a bank. We start to realize that centralized systems do not work out the way we though. Decentralization and the trust in people, actually people are two of the main values of Giveth. All these people, all over the world, who contribute their love and time, their work and ideas into Giveth are Unicorns. People with ideas who want to be part of the movement to change the world and make it a better place are Unicorns.</p><p>Giveth wants to give power back to people while decentralizing systems. One of Giveths goals and values is to make a donation system transparent, complete and absolute. We want to make donations transparent, direct and reliable. And even if Giveth is a charity organization, we are not just talking about donations. We are talking about the structure of governance within the organization, about reliable, accountable people within the Giveth galaxy, about the fact that everyone and anyone can actively participate in the platform, the organization and the idea of Giveth. The future of giving is not just giving ether to a cause that needs support. Giving can of course be monetary but can also be work force, bodys, love, time, minds and ideas for the greater good.</p><p>A lot of people already volunteer for a good cause, give time and love to a project or an idea. Giveth is on the way to build a platform that allows any one of us to make a real change in our community, our neighborhood. I will be able to put up a cause that is important in my direct neighborhood and will make a change and a direct impact in my community ‚Äî and you can too. Because, you not what? No one knows better what‚Äôs going on in your neighborhood than you. Why should anyone donate money to a big, intransparent organization that pays CEO‚Äôs instead of directly to your cause? Your community wants to teach kids how to code, you want to feed the homeless people, you want to gather a couple of people and pick up all the rubbish at your local beach/town/park? Cool, put up a cause on the Giveth platform and start to do so. Giveth believes and trusts in people and in you. This is the highest value any organization can have: the trust in people.</p><p>Shaping the future needs more than just a couple of people, it needs all of us, the human community. So we are calling everyone, to become a Unicorn and join us in the movement to #maketheworldabtterplace.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong> <a href="https://medium.com/u/7d328be176a3?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>jen Giveth</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>üöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöåüöå</p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>we were all going direct the other way‚Äù</em></a></p></blockquote><p><strong><em>‚Äì</em> in short the Unicorns were getting easier and easier to spot as they were coming together to reinvent the most fundamental thing there is.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Giveth is reinventing what it means to be human.</strong></p><p>Humans are not the only life form which create but we have made it our ultimate evolutionary skill. To create is to give and vice versa. Giving is the most primal expression of creating, the most basic level. To voluntarily give something that is yours ( mind, body, property‚Ä¶) by leaving your ownership it becomes something for somebody else. In other words : something changed, transformed, got created.</p><p>So giving, What‚Äôs so special about that? Everybody does it in one way or another. But the giving the Unicorns are talking about is voluntarily or coercion-free! This means no one can force you in any way. Nor are there gatekeepers who have the power to interfere in the process of you giving. The Giveth Unicorns credo is very clear :</p><p>‚Ä¢ Donating can be simple, fun and effective.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Transparency and accountability can be the default.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Every idea has the potential to make a positive impact, and it can be heard and funded in a decentralized fashion.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Every Donor can have the ultimate say over how their donation is used.</p><p>‚Ä¢ People that want to do good work for their cause can be rewarded for their actions.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Real change and innovation comes about when communities join together to make the world a better place.</p><p>Unicorns have always been elusive creatures but now the stars in the Giveth Galaxy have aligned and they are popping up everywhere.

They hope to give the power over sharing and donation out to the very people participating in order to stimulate a positive change of attitude and integrity for the <strong>Decentralized Altruistic Communities</strong> that they are a part of. By using this value system based on participation, innovation, transparency, and accountability the Giveth Unicorns hope to use smart contracts to put donors in charge of how their funds are used, they hope to allow that direct relationship to create a rewarding system for all who are involved so that positivity is felt at the very core of each donation.

Not only this, but it is also accused of its employees exchanging aid for sexual favours, plain and simple sexual abuse. The case has opened the door for a cry of the nonprofit sector to uncover and denounce these practises, which seem to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2018/feb/14/oxfam-allegations-are-tip-of-iceberg-sexual-harassment-and-aid-workers-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more common than one would think</a>.</p><p>Transparency and accountability in charitable donations have been put in check after the scandal broke out, with the International Development Secretary of the UK announcing a big audit of the organizations funded by public money, under <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxfam-sexual-abuse-aid-workers-haiti-prostitutes-scandal-national-crime-agency-mordaunt-latest-a8211211.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat of cutting the funding</a> if their standards are not met. Presumably, such an audit will be expensive and will not bring much to light, as the system is fundamentally opaque, spending more taxpayers‚Äô money that could be dedicated to social impact projects.</p><p>Despite some challenges, I genuinely believe that almost every person working in the development sector is in it to help other people and that they do the best they can. Until now, we didn‚Äôt have tools that allowed for a different governance and management of large amounts of aid funds‚Ä¶ but now we do.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="campaign-based-giving"></a>Campaign-based giving<a class="hash-link" href="#campaign-based-giving" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Nowadays, one gives money to an organization and must trust them to use it properly. The money is given a priori, being a grant from the government, from a granting organization or from individuals. Once the money is in their bank account, it‚Äôs -by design of how the banking system works- opaque to external people: we must trust them again to have proper procedures in place to avoid mismanagement of such funds i.e. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oxfam-in-haiti-it-was-like-a-caligula-orgy-with-prostitutes-in-oxfam-t-shirts-p32wlk0rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúCaligula orgy with prostitutes in Oxfam T-shirts‚Äù</a>.</p><p>With <a href="http://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth</a> you will be able to see how the project is laid out, <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milestone by Milestone</a>, and how much money is required for each and every part. If a Milestone is not achieved, or the Milestone Reviewers (more on this category of validators shortly) perceive misconduct, 1) this Milestone will not be approved and paid out and 2) the Reviewer can decide to send all of the unspent funds back to the original Givers to be donated to other projects.</p><p>The most common issue raised here is: what happens if the Milestone Reviewer(s) is/are ‚Äògreased‚Äô by the Milestone Manager to approve an underachieved Milestone or to turn a blind eye on inappropriate behaviour? I see this as an excellent opportunity to bring together agents that have no special interest in colluding: a grassroots organization, the local community leadership, the government and an independent observer. One could decide that all of these need to agree on the validation and submit proof, similar to the videos used in Giveth‚Äôs <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RewardDAO</a>. Technically, since the figure of the Reviewer is just an Ethereum address, it can be a contract, it could be a multisig wallet held by these relevant stakeholders. Another, if slightly more complex, setup is that a percentage of all Givers to a Campaign need to approve the Milestone after reviewing proof. Using a <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Democracy</a> governance system here would naturally concentrate voting power in people that are reputable and are perceived to be neutral in this particular Campaign or even Milestone.</p><p>I see this as a side benefit of Giveth‚Äôs Campaigns: the need to be in constant communication with Milestone Reviewers and Campaign Managers creates ‚Äî apart from transparency ‚Äî a true Community where problems are openly discussed and input comes from all sides, because everyone has stake in the game.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="communities-solving-problems"></a>Communities solving problems<a class="hash-link" href="#communities-solving-problems" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Thinking of the bigger picture, how can we really shake the giving ‚Äòindustry‚Äô awake? Without questioning the expertise and indubitable economies of scale and know-how transfer of the big International NGOs, Giveth enables another sort of organization: The DAC, the <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decentralized Altruistic Community</a>. Can we do better than just trust Oxfam (or any equivalent INGO) to drop out of the air and deploy their tactics? The Giveth platform can be used for validation of Campaigns and Milestones, but ‚Ä¶ maybe we could go a step further.</p><p>Imagine the creation of a true DAC in Haiti, conformed by Givers, people on the ground (the ‚ÄòMakers‚Äô) and even representation of the INGOs, all communicating with each other and through an agreed form of governance that works to pledge resources the right way. This way we can make sure that Oxfam‚Äôs expertise is allocated where it can impact the most, in constant communication with other stakeholders and with fully transparent decision making.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="you-get-some-decision-power-you-get-some-more-and-you-get-some-too"></a>You get some decision power, you get some more, and you get some too!<a class="hash-link" href="#you-get-some-decision-power-you-get-some-more-and-you-get-some-too" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Does it sound complicated? After all, you are not an expert in Haiti‚Ä¶ maybe you‚Äôve never even been there! How are you supposed to choose where to pledge funds or to know which Campaigns are going to be the most impactful? Giveth has got you covered. With Liquid Pledging, a concept derived from <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid democracy</a>, you can delegate the choice of your donations to Communities you perceive as experts: this can be an influential development group ‚Äî Oxfam if you really must!- but also your former roommate‚Äôs social impact group, which was really into this ‚Äòmaking a better world‚Äô thing. You delegate to a DAC, and it can send your donation to its chosen Campaign, a lot like how charity is supposed to work nowadays, but with much more oversight. You will be able to track your donation, veto any decisions the delegates make and get connected to the people/communities running the Campaigns you will be funding.</p><p>Once you start down the rabbit hole, the possibilities are endless: You can delegate half of your pledged funds to a DAC specializing in disaster relief, which in turn will fund some trusted Campaigns for smaller specific problems. The other half you can delegate to your favourite Campaign focusing on improving education in your hometown or even to another DAC that brings together all education projects in your area.

One vote can now be split in any number of ways between multiple delegates or sent entirely to your chosen delegate, and your delegate can delegate to someone else. Much delegation, so democracy.</p><p>As an example take a busy college student who just doesn‚Äôt have time to vote, she could delegate ¬Ω her vote to her mom and ¬Ω her vote to her professor. If either of them wanted they could allocate a portion of the vote or all of it to a popular politically active persona that acts as a representative for the local community and controls an influential % of the total vote.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="giveth-is-a-perfect-playground-for-implementing-liquid-democracy"></a>Giveth is a perfect playground for implementing liquid democracy<a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-is-a-perfect-playground-for-implementing-liquid-democracy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Of course, the reason we‚Äôre explaining liquid democracy is because it is one of the core technologies that inspired Giveth‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/Giveth/liquidpledging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Pledging</a> system, and we see it as an important building block for the governance of <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DACs</a>.</p><p>While there is no voting inherent in Giveth‚Äôs base layer, there is an opportunity to use a governance system like liquid democracy in the various roles that are filled currently by people such as <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delegates or Reviewers</a>. This would mean that that a delegate, instead of being one person, would become a smart contract that has liquid democracy built in so that the donors can elect several delegates to decide which projects get funded (we will likely use a ‚Äúliquid plutocracy‚Äù model, the more you donate the more votes you get).</p><p>But wait there‚Äôs more, with liquid democracy + blockchain you have the ability to actually codify your vote.</p><p>Yes, I know, code what?</p><p>Codifying your vote could allow you to tag different delegates to represent you based on the subject matter for the initiative. This means that if one initiative has an economic tag your vote for that initiative would be automatically allocated to the delegate you want to represent you on the economic issues, if another initiative carries the environmental tag your vote would be automatically allocated to your environmental delegate. Very diverse, much effective.</p><p>Say an important issue comes up that you feel very strongly about. You can push a button and take your voting back and vote yourself, then push a button and put your delegation settings back the way they were.</p><p>You set the term limits, you can delegate for 20 seconds or 20 years!</p><p>Liquid democracy gives everybody the ability to delegate their vote accordingly or even to overstep the position of their representative keeping them accountable for their actions on a day to day spectrum instead of year to year.</p><p>No one knows exactly what the future of voting looks like, but with Giveth we can start experimenting with this incredible model while making the world a better place at the same time! Much vast, many possibility, sooo future!</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="democracy-30-for-the-transparent-world"></a><a href="https://medium.com/decentfund/democracy-3-0-for-the-transparent-world-5a9f1ffad1ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democracy 3.0 For The Transparent World</a><a class="hash-link" href="#democracy-30-for-the-transparent-world" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>(Updated 11/20 ) Excellent article by <a href="https://medium.com/u/bc1f295769e2?source=post_page-----bd3c63e8df52--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Igor Line</a> on the varied benefits of Liquid Democracy.</p><p>To find out more about liquid democracy and how you can experiment within Giveth:</p><ul><li>Join us on <a href="http://join.giveth.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Riot or Slack</a></li><li>Discover our <a href="http://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Site</a> and <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a></li><li>Fork our code on <a href="http://github.com/Giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a></li><li>Follow us on <a href="http://medium.com/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></li></ul></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/futureOfGiving2017">What is the Future of Giving?</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2017-10-26T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">October 26, 2017 ¬∑ 7 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="/img/krisAuthor.jpeg" alt="Kris"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a>Kris</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle"></small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="an-overview-of-the-giveth-donation-application"></a>An Overview of the Giveth Donation Application<a class="hash-link" href="#an-overview-of-the-giveth-donation-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p><em>Edit: for the current status of the development, more recent updates</em> <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/tagged/dappening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a></p><p>If you ever talked to a Giveth <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unicorn</a> chances are high we did not let you go before you understood what Giveth is all about ‚Äî we‚Äôre a passionate bunch. If you haven‚Äôt met people like <a href="https://medium.com/@thegrifft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griff Green</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jbaylina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordi Baylina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceTorrellas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grace Torrellas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vojtechsimetka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vojtech Simetka</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/team-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many other great faces</a> contributing to the Giveth Platform you might wonder <strong>what it is exactly we‚Äôre building and why.</strong></p><p>To put it plain and simple: we want to make the <strong>process of giving to causes you believe in effective and transparent</strong>, and we are using blockchain technology to do so. In <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-minime-token-open-sourced-by-giveth-2710c0210787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2016</a> the team started developing the DApp (Donation Application) and is now <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coming closer</a> to the release of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In the build-up to this, we would like to take a moment to explain why we are creating the platform and give you a sneak peak of the user flow.</p><p><strong>Wait, but why?</strong></p><p>If you have ever donated to non-profits or charitable organizations chances are high your experience was similar to this one: on your way to the metro you got stopped by a convincing youth who got your name, mailing address and signature for a fixed monthly donation to a specific cause. Since that moment, a few times per year ‚Äî if you‚Äôre lucky ‚Äî you receive an old-school newsletter which you throw away without reading. <strong>You are left entirely in the dark about where your donation went,</strong> and the non-profit receives a monthly amount until you decide to cancel.</p><p>Giveth changes all this. As all donations are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain you can follow, in real-time, who gets your donations and why at a very granular level.</p><p>The Giveth platform has a simple result-based incentive structure: when funds are collected they are stored in our <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-vault-contract-open-sourced-by-giveth-fe2261f7b91b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault</a> and only after Milestones are completed, can the funds be withdrawn. The Giver‚Äôs funds are under their control until their donations are locked for a specific purpose.</p><p>This basic structure gives them a clear view on the various people involved in the process and the possibility to contact everyone directly. And if they don‚Äôt like what their funds are intended to be used for, they have time to block its use.</p><p>We are building the <strong>Future of Giving by cutting out the bureaucracy</strong> so that funds can be spent more efficiently and everyone can collaborate in making the world a better place.</p><p><strong>Talk the Talk</strong></p><p>We are re-engineering how donations are made, and with it, we had to reinvent the <a href="http://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">language</a> to talk about it. The 3 key building blocks of the Giveth system are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones. A <strong>DAC</strong> ‚Äî short for Decentralized Altruistic Community ‚Äî is the group of people united around a cause they want to support. This DAC will fund and steer multiple <strong>Campaigns</strong>, which can in their turn also be supported by more than one DAC. A Campaign translates the dreams of a DAC into a more specific agenda to which action points are linked: we call these the <strong>Milestones</strong>. Milestones are the smallest entity within the Giveth system and are the last step in our donation flow. Once completed, the funds are released into the wild to reimburse and reward good people for their good work.</p><img alt="Building Blocks of Giveth" src="/img/blog/buildingBlocksGiveth.png"><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-3-key-building-blocks-of-giveth-are-communities-dacs-campaigns-and-milestones"></a>The 3 key building blocks of Giveth are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-3-key-building-blocks-of-giveth-are-communities-dacs-campaigns-and-milestones" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>We focus on the technology so people can focus entirely on uniting around causes. In order to do so, we need to define <strong>some of the basic roles</strong> in our system.</p><p>A <strong>Giver</strong> can donate directly to a Campaign they believe in, or can decide to pledge funds to a DAC that will allocate these funds to appropriate Campaigns in the Giver‚Äôs name ‚Äî we call this process <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid pledging</a>. By donating, the Giver automatically becomes part of the DAC and is connected with the rest of the community.</p><p>The <strong>Delegates</strong> are registered DAC members that take on the task of allocating funds sent to their DAC to one or more Campaigns.</p><p>The <strong>Makers</strong> are all the people within these campaigns making the change the DACs want to see in the world. There are a few specific roles the Makers have to fulfill.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Campaign Managers</strong> are the Makers that create Campaigns, assign funds to specific Milestones and make sure their specific Campaign is a success.</li><li>The <strong>Milestone Managers</strong> are the Makers in charge of specific Milestones and need to assure these very specific actions are achieved as described.</li><li>The <strong>Recipients</strong> are the Makers that receive the funds when a Milestone is successfully completed.</li></ul><img alt="Giveth Roles" src="/img/blog/givingBlogRoles1.png"><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="main-roles-within-the-giveth-platform-giver-delegate-campaign-manager-milestone-manager-recipient"></a>Main roles within the Giveth Platform: Giver, Delegate, Campaign Manager, Milestone Manager, Recipient.<a class="hash-link" href="#main-roles-within-the-giveth-platform-giver-delegate-campaign-manager-milestone-manager-recipient" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Two additional roles have been created to <strong>guarantee the correct usage of funds</strong>.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Campaign Reviewer</strong> can reject completion of any Milestone and can, as a strong security measure, even cancel a whole Campaign if it appears to be fraudulent.</li><li>The <strong>Milestone Reviewer</strong>‚Äôs role is to confirm the Milestone Manager really achieved the proposed goal or action described in the Milestone.</li></ul><p>This brings us to the <strong>true power</strong> of the Giveth platform: at all times the Giver knows exactly what is happening to the donated funds, how these are being spent and is in full control through a <strong>transparent network of accountabilities</strong>. If a Milestone is canceled, the funds are returned to the Campaign. If a Campaign is canceled, the funds are automatically returned to the Delegates that supported it. If a Delegate quits, the funds are returned to the Giver. On top of this, one of the most revolutionary aspects of this system is that at any point up until the moment funds are locked into a Campaign, the Giver can decide to withdraw them.</p><img alt="Giveth Additonal Roles" src="/img/blog/givingBlogRoles2.png"><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="two-extra-roles-guarantee-the-correct-usage-of-funds-campaign-reviewer-and-milestone-reviewer"></a>Two extra roles guarantee the correct usage of funds: Campaign Reviewer and Milestone Reviewer.<a class="hash-link" href="#two-extra-roles-guarantee-the-correct-usage-of-funds-campaign-reviewer-and-milestone-reviewer" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>You can discover more about these roles and responsibilities by reading on in <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the product definition</a> on our wiki.</p><p><strong>Walk the Walk</strong></p><p>The Giveth Donation Application is <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now in beta stage on testnet</a>, with all of the roles described above integrated, and currently undergoing testing with a select team of volunteers.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPXoEzuNQzc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="giveth-co-founder-griff-green-explains-what-the-giveth-donation-application-is-about"></a>Giveth co-founder Griff Green explains what the Giveth Donation Application is about.<a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-co-founder-griff-green-explains-what-the-giveth-donation-application-is-about" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>We always have opportunities for skilled developers to contribute to our project, and you can <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/finances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donate</a> to `revolution.eth` to reward and incentivize the devs that are making the Giveth platform a reality.
