Rest assured, we squashed that bug and now the sort/filter/search functionality is working smoothly. We have documented how to obtain a project with a high “quality score” in our <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/guides/qualityscore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth docs</a>. Makers can now ensure that they’re doing everything they can to see their projects rise to the top!</p><p>We’ve upgraded the projects page as well with “infinite scroll”, allowing the user to scroll down the page as new projects load automatically.</p><img alt="Infinite Scroll is fun" class="center" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening2Gif.gif"><p>To further improve upon the quality of projects on our dApp, our team has been working on the new project verification method. We are developing a process in which Makers can submit their projects for review by our team and potentially achieve “verified” status. In the future, verified projects will be eligible for some exciting benefits 😉</p><img alt="Bob Ross for Giveth4Change" class="leftfloat" width="475" height="auto" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening2Meme1.jpg"><p>If you haven’t heard yet, we launched the “<a href="https://medium.com/giveth/calling-all-change-makers-7fa964684c2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change Maker Campaign</a>” with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giveth4Change?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#giveth4change</a>, encouraging Makers to creatively share their stories on how they are making a positive impact in the world we live in. Our favourite projects are going to be highlighted across the Giveth social network, helping them gain cred and support!</p><p>It runs until May 12, 2021, so it’s not too late to submit your projects!</p><hr><p>Coming with our next sprint, we’ll be putting the finishing touches on rich text formatting for project descriptions so Makers can add photos, embed videos, create lists, format texts, and customize the presentation of their project information.</p><p>We’re also continuing to improve email notifications so that our users get appropriate and useful emails in accordance with their interactions on Giveth.</p><p>Further adding to the dApp, we’ll be integrating an embedded support chat so that users on giveth.io can ask questions directly to our team while using the platform.</p><p>Still in the works is the implementation of efficient methods of fiat on-ramping and off-ramping, and we now have more of our team members focusing efforts on resolving this long standing issue.</p><hr><p>As always, we are committed to building the future of giving based on feedback from you, our community!

This is one part of a series of short transparency posts where we keep you in the loop with updates on what’s in development for</em> <a href="http://giveth.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>giveth.io</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Our new DApp <a href="/blog/futureofGiving">went live</a> at <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giveth.io</a> on March 24, 2021, and since then we got some great feedback from our testers and community, and we’ve been hard at work fixing bugs and adding new features.</p><p>First, we addressed the issue of gas fees not being calculated correctly, added an informative banner, and enabled users to login directly on xDai chain. We disabled the ability of a project creator to use a contract address for their project so that donations to all projects can be done either on Mainnet or xDai. We also added more tokens to our list in order to allow the Giver to donate with even more flexibility!</p><p>We onboarded a new member into our dev team and thanks to him we now have functional automated testing that allows us to make changes to the DApp in development and then push to our testing site with greater confidence.</p><p>Next we tackled a bigger fish: the development and implementation of a quality score, sorting/filtering method, and search function to add greater flow and organization to the projects page.</p><img alt="Magic Sorting" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1Meme.gif" width="375" height="auto"><p>Now the projects are sorted by default using a “quality score” — a combination of number of likes, number of donations and quality of project description. We have also added the ability for the user to filter projects by category, and to change the sorting method from the default to “number of likes” or “amount raised”.</p><p>Lastly, you are now able to use the search bar to quickly and easily find the exact project you want to view or Give to!</p><img alt="Filter and Sort on Giveth.io" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1img1.png" width="800" height="auto"><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio">“Filter by Category”, “Sort By” and “Search Projects” Features on <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth.io</a><a class="hash-link" href="#filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>Another exciting update is that we’re now using <a href="https://segment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segment</a> analytics and <a href="https://www.autopilothq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autopilot</a> to track activity on the DApp and send appropriate corresponding notifications. We also worked on some internal organization in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/JftjK8Un3z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> that enables us to receive notifications so we can monitor site actions (such as new project creation, new donation, etc.) in-house.</p><p>In the next sprint we’re excited to continue with QA by getting email notifications working smoothly and ensuring that the donation amount (at time of donation) is being calculated and added to the database correctly.

WOW! Much Excite! The pre-existing Giveth henceforth will be known as Giveth TRACE. The <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Giveth.io Donation Application</a> is an important continuation of our mission to build the future of giving. Both iterations will continue to exist and do contain different features. In this article we’ll be diving into the nitty gritty to help you decide which version of Giveth will aid you the most on your philanthropic venture.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="tldr-"><a href="#summary">TL;DR</a> ←<a class="hash-link" href="#tldr-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Three key distinguishers of the Giveths are: <strong><em>Trust</em></strong>, <strong><em>User Experience,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Scope</em></strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><header><h1><strong><em>Trust</em></strong></h1></header><p>First up let’s talk about Trust. Giveth TRACE (Originally Giveth Beta) was launched in 2017. Following <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the great DAO hack</a> from the previous year, the burning question at the time was: how do we make these new decentralized innovations resilient and trustworthy? Giveth itself was on the frontlines of these events and set out to solve these issues.</p><p>Giveth TRACE employs smart contracts to handle various transparency-oriented functions of the platform. These interactions happen on the blockchain, including traceable donations, escrow, and dispersal of funds. It uses Milestones for specific projects or goals that can have conditions outlined for funds to be released. An example would be to prove work was done on a project or that money was spent to acquire something specific. The milestone contract is employed to act as an escrow. A milestone creator can designate a recipient other than themselves and also a reviewer. The reviewer of a milestone is responsible to assure that any stated expectations were completed before authorizing the smart contract to release the funds to the recipient.</p><p>The new Giveth DApp does not use smart contracts to facilitate donations but instead provides a true peer-to-peer experience where funds go directly from donor to receiver. The resulting transaction is eternally scribed onto the blockchain. There are no escrow or reviewer functions on the Giveth.io DApp so while donations are much more direct, you are encouraged to do your due diligence before donating.</p><header><h1><strong><em>User Experience</em></strong></h1></header><p>Following the rise of ‘cryptokitties’ and the mooning of the price of ETH in 2018, the Rinkeby test network was implemented on Giveth TRACE to resolve absurd gas fees and scalability issues. This allows users to interact with smart contracts on the Dapp for no actual fees, using only gas on Rinkeby to execute the majority of contract transactions. In fact, Giveth actually pays the fees to send your donations to mainnet.</p><img alt="" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/cryptokitties.png" width="450" height="auto"><p><strong><em>“The Rise and Fall of Ethereum circa 2018 AD”</em></strong></p><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="image-source-mediumcom">Image Source: medium.com<a class="hash-link" href="#image-source-mediumcom" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h6><p>Profile creation on Giveth TRACE is facilitated by smart contract interactions on Rinkeby and is reasonably straightforward, however is currently limited to MetaMask. Giveth TRACE currently allows donations in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC and USDC.</p><p>Giveth.io has expanded giving capabilities by allowing donations in ETH and any ERC-20 Token on Mainnet and <a href="https://www.xdaichain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>xDai network</strong></a>! The <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth.io DApp</a> uses Onboard.js to permit virtually any Ethereum wallet to be used for donations. Project creation has been streamlined, so creators can sign-in, make a project and start collecting funds literally in minutes. For creating a profile you may choose between standard MetaMask login or Torus Wallet. Torus Wallet also provides a crypto on-ramping feature so you can convert your cold-hard cash into cryptocurrency very easily and get to donating in the digital age. <a href="https://docs.tor.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More Info on Torus wallet can be found here.</a></p><header><h1><strong><em>Scope</em></strong></h1></header><p>Scope  is the last, but perhaps coolest, distinction I want to mention. Giveth TRACE has <strong>huge</strong> scope: its donation hierarchy is broken down into Communities (formerly known as DACs), Campaigns, and Milestones. Donations made to Communities and Campaigns are stored in a ‘pledge’ vault. The Community or Campaign manager can then delegate your pledge into the Campaign or Milestone, respectively, of their choosing. This system created by Giveth has coined the term ‘Liquid Pledging’ and in effect allows for curated donor funds. This means would-be donors can make non-custodial contributions to causes that they care about and funds can find their way to the right place at the right time. Once your funds have been delegated you’re able to track where they went on Giveth TRACE.</p><p>Giveth.io Dapp aims to provide a simpler experience. While not achieving the same scope of Giveth TRACE it is much easier to navigate. Donations made on Giveth.io go straight A → B and the project owners themselves dictate the scope by the projects they choose to create.</p><header><h1><span id="summary"><strong><em>To Summarize:</em></strong></span></h1></header><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="giveth-trace"><em>Giveth TRACE</em><a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-trace" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Allows for donations on macro and micro levels via Communities, Campaigns, and Milestones</li><li>Has a system of oversight to prevent misuse or fraud</li><li>Donations accepted in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC, and USDC</li><li>Curated Donor Funds via ‘Liquid Pledging’</li><li>Giveth doesn’t charge any fees, in fact we pay the fees to send funds to the recipient</li><li>Works with MetaMask</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="givethio">Giveth.io<a class="hash-link" href="#givethio" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Streamlined project creation accessible for all</li><li>Multi-wallet functionality</li><li>Peer-to-peer transactions</li><li>Giveth doesn’t charge any fees</li><li>Fiat donations via Torus On-ramping</li><li>ETH and ERC-20 token donations</li><li>Donate on <strong>xDai</strong> and save on gas</li></ul><p>The new Giveth is straightforward if you’re looking to make simple donations peer to peer without any added complexity but with more connectivity.

But we have a path we are on, well, actually we have several, and we are doing this on purpose, to make us more resilient, even antifragile. The Ethereum community and the blockchain space as a whole is in constant flux, so we are working on and supporting a wide array of different initiatives (we call it the <a href="https://giveth.io/#galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth Galaxy</a>) that we believe are bringing lasting value to the wider community.</p><p>During this cryptowinter, we ourselves, as a non-profit blockchain-based entity, have been struggling quite a bit to keep financially afloat and have only been able to do this through a generous donation by <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/surprise-285-eth-anonymous-donation-given-to-giveth-9167266a5085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an anonymous donor</a>, but mostly through a constant stream of <a href="https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5b37da13a239ac21b383d4da" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal donations by our co-founder Griff Green</a>, for which we are eternally grateful. This scarcity however got us to discuss our own sustainability quite a bit, and the importance of good, objective governance that will benefit our individual and collective interests, our ‘Commons’. <strong>Depending on pure goodwill, even if it happens in a transparent and accountable way, is not sustainable</strong>, not for us nor for any other altruistic community: it puts you in a scarcity mindset and is a heavy distraction from the cause(s) that unite you. This concern made us see more clearly than ever that we have to invest time in bringing Giving to the next level, and change the way humans collaborate.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="123--infinity"><strong><em>1–2–3 — Infinity.</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#123--infinity" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>First things first, we are very happy and proud to say that <strong>our flagship project, the Giveth DApp,</strong> <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>currently in beta</strong></a><strong>, is now</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/whats-dappening-0x5-ultra-configurable-milestones-27ff92383de2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature-complete</a><strong>,</strong> bringing us very close to what we could call ‘Giveth 1.0’. This of course does not mean that we will stop working on the DApp, on the contrary, much more is coming, such as deploying our DApp on the <a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-partners-with-makerdao-on-xdai-chain-the-first-ever-usd-stable-blockchain-65a078c41e6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xDAI chain</a>, introducing governance solutions through <a href="http://aragon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a>, a complete UX overhaul and so much more. This is all in the making but in order to continue with this, we are currently focusing very hard on the funding part of the puzzle<strong>.</strong> We want to help forward the ecosystem itself through an ambitious token-engineering experiment, in collaboration with <a href="https://block.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlockScience</a>. <strong>The target of this experiment is to transform communities around altruistic causes into entire economies and to build this on top of the Giveth DApp.</strong> In the coming months, we will be working hard on this initiative that will bring us at some point to what we like to call ‘Giveth 2.0’.</p><p>Now that we have traceable donations working in the DApp, we can start to experiment with new models to support both the organization as well as the funding of communities. Your support stays very, very welcome (<a href="http://giveth.io/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all tokens accepted</a> 🙏) but in the long run, we want to incentivize you so that you are no longer just a Giver, but have a real stake in the success of the community you will be supporting: <strong>we want to align the very human behavior of profit-seeking with socially beneficial behavior: to us this is the real Future of Giving</strong>.</p><p>We built the foundational layer of our Giveth DApp on the Ethereum blockchain and not on a centralized server to bring <strong>true accountability and transparency to decentralized governance experiments</strong>: there is an immutable piece of evidence of what happened with your funds. The true magic however, that will allow us to create sustainable streams of funding, lies hidden within the existing dynamics of blockchain technology. <strong>Every blockchain network in existence has aligned incentives around supporting the network itself: every ‘actor’ in the system, when acting in their own best interest, actually benefits the system.</strong> Miners earn inflation for supporting the network, developers hold the token hoping their efforts will raise its value, and users buy the token creating demand and pay transaction fees: it is a very simple and well-balanced ecosystem: <strong>helping yourself, helps the system to thrive, and very often it doesn’t even matter whether that system is useful or not.</strong></p><p>We are building the Future Of Giving and are fascinated by these mechanisms, we want to use these self-sustaining models for actual good. <strong>The ‘Commons’</strong> can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined</a> as “<!-- -->[<!-- -->…<!-- -->]<!-- --> resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage <strong>for individual and collective benefit</strong>.” We, and many communities like ours, that are organized around social impact causes, are suffering from scarcity, because <strong>we think about the collective benefit and ignore the individual,</strong> who needs to survive as well; this is unsustainable. By default, people will actually do the opposite and take their individual interest over that of the common good, which is often called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tragedy of the commons</a>. In <strong>both cases</strong>, there is a major incentive alignment issue: either the individual gains but the collective suffers or the other way around. Witnessing for a while now these emerging, more sustainable systems, we believe it is time for the next step. By modeling the success of existing blockchain ecosystems (through the implementation of new cryptoeconomic primitives) we want <strong>to create abundance to support the Commons</strong>, thinking about both the collective as well as the individual interests.</p><p>Now, our goal at Giveth is to use token engineering, more specifically, Curation Markets, to bring this from a purely digital realm, into the real world. We will build it on top of our Dapp, and <strong>build it in such a way that it supports projects that benefit our common interest</strong>, or in other words, that will enable us to sustainably crowdfund the Commons. The initial work was to enable transparent and accountable donations on the blockchain, the next step is to move away from ‘donating’ altogether and to create a sustainable system: <strong>gifted funds become backed by a token of value in a circular economy.</strong> As <a href="https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abbey Titcomb</a> says:</p><blockquote><p>“We believe the answer to the underfunding of social goods and underserved community contribution is to reframe social goods as self-governing and continuously funded commons.”</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="wait-but-how"><strong>Wait but How?</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#wait-but-how" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Through building the augmented bonding curve model created by <a href="https://block.science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlockScience</a> on top of our DApp we want to create continuously funded organizations. How does this work? We first learned about them through <a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffemmett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Emmett</a>, a Giveth collaborator, who explains the basic building blocks — a highly recommended read to learn more on how token bonding curves could enable a project to bootstrap funding and token value along with project success and popularity. You can find more references in Abbey Titcomb’s report on <a href="https://medium.com/@abbey_titcomb/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what we built at ETHDenver</a>, and for all <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelzargham/jargon-party-e3616cd16a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical definitions</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/block-science/on-the-practice-of-token-engineering-part-i-c2cc2434e727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more theory</a>, we refer you to <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelzargham" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Zargham</a>.</p><p>However, we would like to illustrate the theory now through a real life example of how this could work, imagining a future in which Giveth has already built this model into its DApp (also available <a href="https://youtu.be/WJ23oQpooG0?t=694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in video format, narrated by Griff Green</a>):</p><p>So imagine you live by the beach, and you have the habit of picking up trash regularly, but you see this is just not having the impact you desire: it doesn’t scale. For more impact you are also regularly donating to a nonprofit promising exactly this, large-scale impact but … all you see is a lot of marketing and a continuous request for more funds. This is all very frustrating.</p><p>At this point in time, you run into Jonathan, an activist who you often saw on the beach doing exactly what you do: cleaning up. He tells you about a new kid on the block: the ‘TrashHeroes’ and they are offering you something else. They invite you to not just give money but to actually help them steer the organization. In return for an amount you choose you will receive tokens, tokens that allow you to make decisions for the common good of the organization. On top of this, if you do a good job and the organization runs smoothly one day those tokens could be worth more than what you donated. This sounds too good to be true, but hey, you were donating funds anyways and with this one you get a say in the decisions!</p><p>So you give 10 xDAI (<a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-partners-with-makerdao-on-xdai-chain-the-first-ever-usd-stable-blockchain-65a078c41e6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a representation of DAI token</a>) and receive TrashHero Tokens, which you hear actually have value, in the real world. <strong>The value however, is not determined by an open market, but by a smart contract</strong>, which is actually the token bonding curve. So how does this work you ask? The price, the value of the TrashHero Token, is determined by the total supply of the token in general: if more people mint the token in return for xDAI, the price of the TrashHero Token goes up. If the supply goes down — when people burn their tokens and take money out of the contract the price of the token goes down. <strong>The big difference however with existing curve models, and which makes this one sustainable is two-fold.</strong> First, there is <strong>the curve itself</strong> which disincentivizes people who get in late to burn their tokens quickly, they need to keep these for a while if they want to make a profit. The second element is that people who get in early should be the people who are in it for the long haul, because they are the believers in the cause, they will most often be the experts. This is stimulated by preventing our pioneers from burning their tokens immediately: <strong>their tokens are locked until specific goals</strong> (which we call Milestones in our DApp) have been reached. In this way the collective interests you are fighting for are protected by default, the Commons needs those funds and outweigh your short-term self-interest, and you are incentivized to reach the set goals, the Milestones. <strong>This innovative system where everyone acts in their own self-interest, propels the Commons forward and pushes it to reach its set goals.</strong></p><p>Back to our TrashHeroes that have invited you to be part of this initial group of experts who together have raised quite some xDAI to initialize the curve and the TrashHero Commons. One half, 50% of this xDAI, is locked in the smart contract, 50% of this xDAI is given to a DAO controlled by the TrashHero token holders to execute on their common interest, now baptized the TrashHero Commons. <strong>This Commons that supports the cause of cleaning up the beaches will now need to come up with good proposals to actually support this cause. As the Commons spends money, the tokens that were given to the group that initialized the curve will become unlocked periodically.</strong> This spending goes through Milestones you help create in the Giveth DApp: xDAI will be released once the initiative takers (the ‘Milestone Managers’) prove they have actually reached the goals they set that support the Commons’ cause (i.e. cleaning up beaches) — this is where the power of Giveth kicks in: <strong>you only get rewarded when you are being accountable</strong>.</p><p>The effective working of the TrashHero Commons is steered through a novel type of curation market governance system that allows you to use your TrashHero Tokens to signal priorities of tasks (Milestones) to be executed for the Commons to reach its goals. When a target that supports the goals of the Commons is proposed — for example, you get 15 friends together and make a Milestone for doing a side-by-side, step-by-step cleaning of 5 km of coast — and if it is supported by the TrashHero Token holders, it will receive funding from the Commons: xDAI will be sent to the Giveth Milestone. Then once the task has been completed, by documenting in pictures and videos the gathering of 3 tons of plastic and waste, the xDAI will be sent to the token bonding curve and you will be minted TrashHero Tokens, which you can then decide to burn immediately (without a need to speculate if you don’t want to) to receive your xDAI. When you or anyone else decides to burn your tokens, there is a fee that goes back into the Commons, which is the lever that will support more social good. <strong>To us, this is the Future of Giving</strong>: your socially beneficial behavior creates a surplus!</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJ23oQpooG0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="griff-greens-talk-at-ethcc-paris-on-the-evolutionary-movement-of-human-collaboration-through-blockchain-trashhero-commons-example-starts-at-1055"><em>Griff Green’s talk at EthCC Paris on the evolutionary movement of human collaboration through blockchain (TrashHero Commons example starts at</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/WJ23oQpooG0?t=655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>10:55</em></a><em>)</em><a class="hash-link" href="#griff-greens-talk-at-ethcc-paris-on-the-evolutionary-movement-of-human-collaboration-through-blockchain-trashhero-commons-example-starts-at-1055" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="generosity-generates-income"><strong>Generosity generates Income</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#generosity-generates-income" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Doing good <em>feels</em> good, and we hope our alternative economic system will attract more people who want to do good by not just giving but by staying involved. <strong>Instead of just simply donating, they get the opportunity to participate in a circular economy that supports the underlying cause</strong>. As more people will be encouraged to join the Commons, it incentivizes the people who initialized the curve to do even better, as the initial token holder’s funds will only be unlocked as the community actually does good, and spends the money. <strong>By being generous and by participating in good governance they can generate an actual financial return, an income — they create abundance.</strong></p><p>Next to this, speculators will get involved, because that is what happens with tokens, and actually, its great! Secondary markets and the trading volume will hopefully create an extra flow of funds that isn’t normally part of a charitable community. <strong>After the initialization of the curve, the new donations create tokens that have no locking period, and 100% of those funds go straight into the bonding curve.</strong> When later participants burn their tokens they however always pay a fee, and this fee goes back into the Commons, which further support its goals. Every participant — whether it is an initial crowdfunder, a regular Giver or a speculator — should and will act in their own self-interest, which is steering the Commons to become a success, with everyone’s incentives aligned.</p><p><strong>One more important note: this is a giant experiment and it may not work.</strong> However because of the use of the Giveth DApp the projects that are looking to clean up beaches, help the homeless or do research to cure Alzheimer are insulated from the governance experiment’s failure. <strong>The benefit is that these initiatives will exist on our Giveth DApp, so there are multiple ways to fund them.</strong> If a token holder really wants a specific Giveth Milestone to be supported but the governance of the Commons breaks down for one reason or another, they can burn their token (again helping the economy through a small fee), receive xDAI, and send it directly to the specific Milestone on the DApp they wanted to support. The Commons is one actor in an open system. What we will have done is create an extra way to fund projects on our DApp and most probably generate quite some buzz around that specific economy, a buzz supported both by the community as well as by speculators. Whatever happens, more people will know that this cause needs to be supported.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-started-building-this-future-of-giving-yesterday"><strong>We started Building this Future of Giving Yesterday</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#we-started-building-this-future-of-giving-yesterday" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With every statement we make, new questions come up (for example <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/!vwFGsktMNkdorFWJRi:matrix.org/$1552247327760014NjKKA:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&amp;via=giveth.io&amp;via=status.im" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this dialogue in our chat</a>), and we do not have all the answers just yet.

They aren’t. Self-managed organizations exist all over the world, but there is no template for how a decentralized self-managed organization should work. Let us try to change that.</em></p><p>Self-managed organizations (those without a management middlemen layer and hierarchy) have to overcome a lot of hurdles when it comes to governance. For example, on one side, the direction of the organization cannot be dictated top-down by management and on the other side nobody can push responsibility up and “just do what they are told”.</p><p>These hurdles, Frederic Laloux, author of “<a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinventing Organizations</a>” suggests, exist mainly because traditional management practices and traditionally managed organizations are so prevalent that we have a lack of examples to follow. In other words, we might have never seen better! Moreover, there have been years and years of organizational research and practice on hierarchical structures (think both about an old-age tribe with a clear, visible head and also a large corporation with a twitter rant-prone CEO).</p><p>On top of that, we have new models of governance arising within blockchain structures or enabled by blockchain solutions (<a href="https://medium.com/@leo_pold_b/blockchain-governance-takeaways-from-nine-projects-8a80ad214d15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s</a> a pretty good article that touches on some of the key points), although there is not so much literature on specifically non-hierarchical, egalitarian structures.</p><p>While there are great companies pushing the envelope in both blockchain governance and self-management, it’s time for us to investigate, explore and document different forms of non-hierarchical governance for organizations. Giveth’s Governance Circle, and particularly <a href="https://twitter.com/Loie_Low" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loie</a>, whose goal is to foster governance experiments, is launching the Unicorn DAC on that regard. Lorelei devoted countless hours to ideate, iterate and bring to life this project with the rest of the Unicorns… and this is the result.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="stepping-up-the-game">Stepping up the game<a class="hash-link" href="#stepping-up-the-game" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Operationally, Giveth works much like a swarm. Around a strong core of main contributors, collaborators that are aligned with the purpose of Giveth come and go and offer their time, ideas and work. Some of these collaborators do one assignment and leave and others stay collaborating on the periphery but for the longest time. They are rewarded through a mechanism called <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RewardDAO</a>, with which everyone can get points that then can be exchanged for ether if they upload a video on our <a href="https://fame.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall of Fame</a> or to the <a href="https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3d9746329bc64ae74d1424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp itself</a>.</p><p>But these points are awarded somewhat arbitrarily and there’s a limited amount of monthly ether that goes to fund these rewards. Hence, the amount that collaborators receive in ether can vary depending on other people’s contributions and points. We think it’s a great introductory system for getting into the Giveth Galaxy, but might not be ideal as a fully decentralized non-hierarchical governance model. In fact, it’s not really a complete governance model, as it doesn’t necessarily steer Giveth’s big decisions, but our experience tells us that it does motivate people to take initiative, talk to the most committed contributors and suggest new projects and initiatives.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="put-your-money-where-your-purpose-is"><strong>Put your money where your purpose is</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#put-your-money-where-your-purpose-is" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To be clear, governance in self-managed organizations boils down to who decides — and how it is decided — what the organization dedicates its resources to?</p><p>So in the case of Giveth, the question was: How could we empower everyone that is fully committed to Giveth to decide what actions and what strategic direction should the organization take? And even further, could we do that in a way that we leverage our own products, i.e. the Giveth DApp? -we do like our #dogfooding!</p><p>Well, the Giveth DApp allows Makers to create <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DACs, Campaigns and Milestones</a>, and Givers to fund whatever change they want to see realized in the world. Could we not create a DAC that Unicorns can use to propose projects through Milestones, and other Unicorns can fund them if they think they are aligned with Giveth’s purpose? We would distribute money to our Unicorns — this group of core contributors — and they could fund any Milestone they wanted.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What better way to steer an organization than by democratizing both the access to resources and the power to propose actions and then let everyone actually put resources where the Giveth purpose lies the strongest?</strong></p></blockquote><p>Sometimes Unicorns will decide to fund already existing Milestones, and sometimes they will create a new bounty. This gives everyone the power to suggest a project, give it a price tag, and if the funding target gets reached, empower and pay this person to make it happen. If it doesn’t get funded, it would mean that the project was possibly not so aligned with the general feeling and purpose anyway.</p><p><strong>Examples of funded proposals:</strong></p><p>a) Lorelei is often frustrated by the lack of sharing info in the Ethereum community. Everybody seems to be having the same conversations but no one is hearing each other. When she hears about Tennagraph, the community signaling aggregator to answer just this need, she becomes very passionate about it and decides to use her Unicorn DAC delegation allowance to fund Deam to go to Web3 Summit and raise awareness and adoption for Tennagraph!</p><p>b) Lanski has identified a feature for our <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp</a> that a bunch of Makers would like to have in the platform. It might not seem it’s a priority from a technical point of view, but as a matter of fact, all the feedback that he is receiving from the users mentions that particular need. He assesses the cost with the DApp team and creates a Milestone where they (the DApp team) are the beneficiary. The work, though, is too expensive and he cannot pay it on his own, but Lorelei realizes how important the feature is and funds the Milestone too so the DApp team can go ahead and build it to claim the Milestone.</p><p><strong>Example of an unsuccessful proposal:</strong></p><p>Lanski wants to make stickers of Giveth’s logo to stick all over the world — for marketing purposes. Everyone has got some stickers left from the last batch, but not enough to cover half of the world with them, so he wants to make MORE. But the general consensus is that we are publicizing well and doing the right outreach in the circles that we want to attract at this stage, so nobody actually funds the Milestone. Sorry Lanski, maybe later when we decide to do a publicity campaign for the general public!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="ins-and-outs-of-the-unicorn-dac"><strong>Ins and outs of the Unicorn DAC</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#ins-and-outs-of-the-unicorn-dac" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This Governance experiment is precisely that, an experiment. And the initial parameters are sort of arbitrarily defined and will be polished as we go along.</p><ol><li>We’ve been a community gathered around shared principles and purpose for a while now, but never had an official onboarding process because there’s no clear entity to be onboarded to. Now, we have the opportunity to come together around these agreements and create a membrane that gathers and recognizes the most committed of us as we join the Unicorn DAC. You can read about our Onboarding Process <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/unicorn-dac/unicorn-onboarding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, which ensures commitment to Giveth’s purpose and alignment with our principles in order to opt to be part of the DAC.</li><li>The resource allowance per head will be the equivalent in ether to 600 USD every week. In order for people not to fund only their own Milestones, we have capped the amount people can put into their own Milestones at 150 USD, so 450 will be used to decide on other people’s initiatives. Unicorns don’t have to use the full 600 USD every week if they feel that there are no interesting projects to fund, or the ones that are truly interesting are already fully funded.</li><li>Needless to say, people can choose NOT to fund any of their own Milestones. The reason why we allow people to self-fund their Milestones for a certain amount is to facilitate the funding of menial or uninteresting jobs that have to be done, but they would waste people’s time and resources if they had to be reviewed and funded by other unicorns.</li><li>We cannot expect people to feel connected to a purpose by only chipping money into Milestones. Hence, in order to keep purpose alive, we have a once a month Unicorn Meeting! Here, we discuss which projects we delegated to and why it is aligned to Giveth.</li><li>As a rule of thumb, Milestones will be created by those who hold roles related to the matter at hand. That’s not to say that people can’t have great ideas outside of their roles, but they should follow the <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/advice-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advice process</a> and certainly consult with those who hold relevant roles before taking action, even if it is merely for keeping information flows going. Roles are evaluated on how well they have been fulfilled in a peer review system every month.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="mvping-our-way-through-it"><strong>MVPing our way through it</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#mvping-our-way-through-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We are ready to try the Unicorn DAC and carve our own way in decentralized governance practices. As the experiment that it is, we do expect some issues to come up, and we have already identified a few:</p><ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dogfooding</a> is our motto because we believe the Giveth DApp is a great tool. Nevertheless, it does not yet have the advanced functionalities of a compounded delegation system that would allow you to allocate only up to a percentage of funds into your own Milestones and the rest to others. We will track donations manually at this point while we look for a solution, be it homemade or leveraging <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a>.</li><li>Foreign influence. Our DAC will always be public, transparent and held to the highest standards, but the fact that it’s an open way to fund the projects that Giveth undertakes, it could be exposed to an admittedly unlikely vector of attack where a powerful party decides to fund specific Milestones or projects that are on the periphery of the purpose and this acts in detriment of the best direction to take. This would be a similar attack to sovereignty to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893815001003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMF dictating policies to countries</a> in exchange for bailouts or access to concessional loans.</li><li>That said, we have funds to support this initiative for a limited period of time, and since Giveth is a non-profit blockchain entity that accepts donations, if you are a donor and <strong>want to support Blockchain4Good projects PLUS a decentralized non-hierarchical governance experiment like the Unicorn DAC</strong>, we are all ears (and eyes!): hit us up on <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Riot</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Givethio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> or fund us <a href="https://giveth.io/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly</a>!</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="already-winning"><strong>Already winning</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#already-winning" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Unicorn DAC was presented during DevCon4 at the <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/devcon4-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon Dream DAO contest</a>… and it won the runner-up prize! 250 ANT + 250 DAI for making it a reality!

Gone are the days where you could work 30 years at a company, then get a fancy watch and a golden handshake into retirement. The industrial revolution of the early 1800’s brought more people out of the country and into factories and workshops, attracted by better pay.</p><p>And while offices were growing in number back then, it wasn’t until the 20th century that office culture became a mainstream phenomenon. Now with the arrival of the internet and, more recently, blockchain we are seeing another shift in the way people work.</p><p>At <a href="https://medium.com/bounties-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Bounties Network</strong></a> and <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-social-coding:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Giveth Social Coding</strong></a> we decided to collaborate on this topic. So we recently posed and posted a question about The Future of Work:</p><blockquote><p><em>“If you love your employees let them go, to Thailand, to school, to a sabbatical where ever they might choose. The constraints placed on us today in the working economy are unreasonable and completely unconducive to personal growth, truth, happiness and workplace fulfilment.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Today we’re going to integrate some of the responses from <a href="https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/1641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>that post</strong></a> to get a better idea of how the future of work may look like.</p><header><h1>Location, Location, Location</h1></header><p>The company of the future is no longer bound by company walls or even country borders for that matter. Employers are starting to understand that sourcing the best talent at the right price is more important than where they are located. Poster <strong>Jose Aguinaga</strong> highlights this about his international company:</p><blockquote><p><em>In our company, we are roughly 15+ employees/designers all over the world. We have people from Mexico City to New Zealand, in Vancouver and Sofia. We started in Switzerland, and have embraced a decentralized workspace from day 1.</em></p></blockquote><p>Many jobs these days only require a laptop and a good internet connection</p><p>The internet ushered in the digital economy and a huge percentage of job postings these days are looking for digital skills. The obvious benefit of this is that you can work remotely just about anywhere you have a computer and a decent internet connection.</p><p>Jose goes on to explain, however, that remote working is not for everybody. It requires discipline, flexibility, and a sense of responsibility that may not suit everyone’s personality. Some workers are just not cut out for that kind of independence. To be clear, many jobs still require us to be in the same space. But in the future, we will be able to solve many of the problems that come with trying to cram so many people into big cities.</p><header><h1>Working in Tune with Your Own Rhythms</h1></header><p>Let’s expand on that a bit. As many of you will know, working a 9–5 job in a major city can be a real headache. With worldwide populations continuing to grow, it’s not unheard of to hear people spend 2–3 hours every day commuting to work. But now many companies are starting to wake up to the fact that many tasks are not time-specific. Do you really need to be in the office at 9 to respond to client emails for an hour?</p><p>In addition, employees are not robots (most anyway) and do not function with on/off switches. Every worker is unique and possesses strengths and weaknesses. People produce their best work at various times of the day. User <strong>Brad</strong> highlighted this in his post with the following words:</p><blockquote><p><em>It has been repeatedly shown that creative and intelligent minds are more likely to be night owls, and unlikely to stay tied down to one place for long periods of time.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now whether or not that fits your profile is irrelevant. Some people love the early morning hours and take the afternoon off. Some work perfectly in the 9–5 structure. Others, as Brad suggests, work well into the night when the peace and quiet provide plenty of opportunities to get work done.</p><p>To add to that, most workers would agree that one of the most important aspects of a job is a healthy working environment. Happy employees are productive workers. Poster <strong>Bount<!-- -->_<!-- -->Hunter</strong> highlights this well in his/her post:</p><blockquote><p><em>If the person you want to do X job for you is happier to be doing it a 8pm -4 am in Malaysia vs 9–5 in chicago their work will always be better. We’ve all worked jobs we HATE (i’m currently doing that now) and you don’t get the best work from people who are working jobs they don’t like.</em></p></blockquote><header><h1>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</h1></header><p>It should come as no surprise then that decentralized organizations are springing up everywhere. And blockchain is pioneering this effort with projects dedicated to making that kind of a future a reality. Take <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Aragon</strong></a> for example, a project aimed at breaking down traditional borders and intermediaries.</p><p>In the modern world, much of the existing business value is captured by those at the top of the pyramid. It’s a little sad then that many of the people creating that value don’t actually get rewarded for doing so. The workplace of tomorrow will flatten these management structures and allow the value to be distributed more evenly.</p><p>Take this very article for example. It was crowd-sourced and funded from contributors around the world using a decentralized application. What could be more empowering than allowing employees to have an active stake and say in the company and process from the get-go?</p><header><h1>Closing Thoughts: The Future of Work</h1></header><p>It’s sometimes hard to see a change in the future of work since we’ve been following a centralized hierarchical office model for many years now. The only thing we can be certain of is change. Those that embrace it are usually the ones who reap the most rewards in the new economy.</p><p>Finally, to highlight the real-life change we are facing as work evolves, let me tell you a little about my own history. I am a South African who is dating a German who lives in the Netherlands. My mother is Italian and I work part-time for an American company. Borders are completely artificial constructions of man. The human spirit doesn’t want to be tied down by the rules of a few men sitting in an office somewhere. The future of work is exciting. The future of work is decentralized.</p><p>Are you ready to join us in the distributed work space?

Most of us are very, very tech-minded and geeky people, and we love tech, but that is not what it is about or why we are here. It is about the people, the human connection.</p><p>We live in a world that has never been more connected, but never have we felt more isolated, never have our individualistic traits and our ego been more nurtured (think social media, for one) than today. But has it made us happier? Definitely not. Even worse, it has made us retreat into ourselves, giving less, both emotionally as well as financially. Giveth wants to turn the tide, bring back the connection by building/buidling and making the World a Better Place.</p><p>We are not an organization, not a DAO, we strive to be more, we are a Decentralized Altruistic Community (a DAC). Communities are based on shared values and this is what corporations and organizations lack. They do pretend to have core values, but these are outward facing, top-down and are used for branding purposes. Our values are bottom-up, crowdsourced and are the higher good that connects us.</p><p>We are a community of individuals and we celebrate and respect each and everyone’s uniqueness.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-dare-to-be-vulnerable">We dare to be Vulnerable<a class="hash-link" href="#we-dare-to-be-vulnerable" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Our main value, our essence lies in vulnerability. Most of the people at Giveth, and even in the wider ‘Maker’ blockchain space (=the opposite of daytrader land) are here because they know what ego and image brings to the world. They are professionals who have lived the corporate life and knew something was ‘off’. Hierarchy and image boosting bring pain, misunderstanding and most of all a huge waste of time and loads of inefficiency.</p><p>When you dare to be vulnerable - even fragile, open and true - you can make lasting changes, because it’s the only way to truly connect with another human being. And together, when you connect, you always achieve more.</p><p>Another crucial reason to open up is because ‘the system’ has trained us to be numb by providing us with all possible tools (binge-watching, medication, social media, shopping, … the list is endless). We have been trained to care less, to be less conscious of suffering and injustice, during a time where we are actually hyper-connected and thus can be hyper-informed. Knowledge brings power: sharing your thoughts, ideas and feelings can change the world. We just have to express our <strong>outrage</strong> and team up, because right now, as individuals, together, we actually have a bigger impact than ever before in the history of mankind.</p></blockquote><p>(Please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THIS</a> if you never have before)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-are-inclusive">We are Inclusive<a class="hash-link" href="#we-are-inclusive" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Everyone is welcome, we are huggers.

Abundance is the opposite of fear and scarcity, the things that make people become protective and close-minded. We want to give people the chance to develop themselves. We want to be a spark of light, a pulsing star in this galaxy, an inspiration to others, an energy that rubs off.</p><p>Only if we harness this internal energy we will be able to make real and lasting change in this world. When there is abundance people thrive and are able to not only show off their skills but their talents. The difference between skills and talents is that you no longer only do what you are good at, you do what brings happiness into your life and you bring this into the lives of others.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-are-striving-to-be-fully-decentralized">We are striving to be fully Decentralized<a class="hash-link" href="#we-are-striving-to-be-fully-decentralized" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Money is not evil.

How do we go about making a real impact?</p><p>When the systems available to us are inherently flawed, we stop relying upon those systems to achieve our goals. With tools and technologies hitherto nonexistent, we instead build a new platform for giving for the future.</p><p>The desire to make the world a better place hasn’t changed, but the tools available to do so have. At the intersection of this drive to do good and the opportunities opened up to us through blockchain technology and decentralized governance, you’ll find a group of individuals known as Unicorns.

With the tools and technologies available to us, there’s no more bureaucracy to siphon off funds along the way to the recipients. Giveth doesn’t even take a cut — it doesn’t need to — it’s funded through the same process as the project you just donated to.</p><p>If you have plentiful time to donate through traditional volunteer opportunities, you’ll find the Giveth platform maximizes the efficiency and impact of the work you do with clearly defined milestones and the minimal number of actors needed to accomplish the goal. Transparency and accountability are built in, so your work is both noticed and supported by your fellow Unicorns as well as the donors themselves.</p><p>If you have willpower and like-minded individuals and you decide to initiate your own causes, you’ll discover an easy-to-use toolset that enables you to create a project with the same ease as creating a blog post. You’ll immediately be able to start receiving donations and create clear steps to achieving your ultimate outcome with no red-tape or fees of any kind.</p><p>The best part about Giveth is that anybody can join the community and contribute to making the world a better place. If you’re a human being living on planet Earth and you want to do good, we are your people, and this is your opportunity to make a real impact.

At its core Giveth enables communities to form around the causes that matter to them the most. On a personal level Giveth is the reason I shifted my vision from only seeing fungible stores of value loosely referred to as ‘crypto’ and decided to dedicate my corporeal energy to enabling trust within this space. A bit about me is in order first however.</p><p>I came to ‘crypto’ not as a newbie but someone who was well versed in utilizing cryptographic hashes and technology within daily operations. My first introduction to personal computers came in 1986 when my family moved to Houston TX, and I would play games like ‘Wheel of Fortune’ , ‘Ninja Gaiden’, and ‘SpiderMan’ on our IBM 8086. My first tech job came at the age of 17 where I taught children QBASIC, html, and audio processing at the ‘American Computer Experience’ summer camps. Fast forward to 2009 and my technolust was immediately sparked by this thing I caught wind of called Bitcoin. I had no position in the market other than watching the price of BTC go from near nothing to over $10 USD/BTC.</p><p>In August of 2017 life dealt me two perspective altering situations within a week: Hurricane Harvey and losing my job as a Corporate Security Analyst of 5 years. The loss of my position was heartbreaking but being surrounded by constant destruction brought on by an “800 year flood” kept me sane and sober. By December life had begun to return back to normal for most of us Houstonian’s, however something incredible was taking place with the price of Bitcoin: it was over $10,000/BTC!</p><p>The dramatic increase of volume plus pricing momentum within Bitcoin caused me to study value theory and seriously contemplate just wtf was going on. Whether it was serendipity, fate, or just plain dumb luck I discovered Giveth via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iShzx6iqwus&amp;index=15&amp;list=PLIR2KLUqBsWnbhDZKi0S43Q5PnxFGdiEo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube presentation</a> from Griff Green at the Ethereum Community Conference 2018. At this point all of my attention shifted studying pricing and volatility to determining how to best distribute trust.</p><p>Giveth will play a key role in enabling communities to distribute trust via decentralized governance. At a high level, Giveth can be viewed as software that enables communities to form causes and promote those causes via group determined milestones. Individuals who are part of a given community can spawn their own milestones, and via pledging of ETH to those milestones prioritize what is and is not important for that community with 100% transparency. Additionally those who give within this structure can be notified when their milestone is reached as well as delegate authority of their contribution to others within their community.</p><p>Giveth is not an ICO, a corporation, or a monolithic organization that promises to render aid while capturing the majority of users contributions in times of need (most charities). Giveth is an opportunity to do better by humanity via distributed trust within systems of decentralized governance that <!-- -->*<!-- -->anyone<!-- -->*<!-- --> can run.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/40f75102c422?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Meefs</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩</p><blockquote><p>~DAppLion</p></blockquote><p>🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧</p><p><strong>Why Giveth?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We believe in the power of communities to solve problems.</p><p>We believe in decentralized technology to unleash the creativity and energy of altruistic communities.</p><p>Giving is a humanitarian act of solidarity and empathy — we believe in the fundamental rights and dignity of every human being.</p><p>We are doing nothing less than reinventing giving!</p></blockquote><p><strong>What?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We build a platform for trust and transparency in giving.</p><p>Decentralized altruistic communities promote social innovation and create opportunities for people.</p><p>This platform is in strong contrast to the systems currently in place: bureaucratic, inflexible, centralized, with a lot of overhead</p></blockquote><p><strong>How?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We are enthusiastic and passionate — we do a hell of a lot of amazing stuff.</p><p>We are a community — open, transparent, cooperative, companionable and focused to deliver.</p><p>We are an active part of the Ethereum eco-system and contribute to the development of Ethereum.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Ron Mat</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️⛵️</p><blockquote><p><strong>“You can’t go around building a better world for people. Only people can build a better world. Otherwise it’s just a cage.” — Terry Pratchett</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you want to understand what Giveth values are and what it means to be a Unicorn and to be part of the Giveth community, you has to understand that the simple goal of all Unicorns in the Giveth galaxy, all around the world is, to make the world a better place.</p><p>This starts with the fact that Giveth trusts in people, real, actual people.</p><p>Let me explain why this is an amazing, outstanding fact in 2018. We spend the last years and maybe generation with the trust in the big systems and cooperations. The (centralized) banking system, centralized political systems with so called “representatives of the people” who rule countries and do not even know any longer what is going on in a country, the idea that the fact that we are allowed to go to vote every 4 (or 5 years) is all it needs for a democracy to work. We trusted in this centralized systems to rule the world and sort out our human problems. What we end up with was a banking crisis, plastic rubbish all over the planet, a so called refugee crisis and more and more the distrust in systems. We trust in charity organizations all over the world to sort out what we humans fucked up in the past and wonder in the end that we do not know what happened with the donations that we made. We trusted in system for a long time, until we realized that this systems are not working out the way we wanted. We realized that no one will sort out all the rubbish in the oceans and at the beaches if we do not start doing it ourselves, more and more people realize that we need to take our power as citizens back to actually have a say in a democracy, we start to realize that it makes sense to have a reliable person we can trust instead of a bank. We start to realize that centralized systems do not work out the way we though. Decentralization and the trust in people, actually people are two of the main values of Giveth. All these people, all over the world, who contribute their love and time, their work and ideas into Giveth are Unicorns. People with ideas who want to be part of the movement to change the world and make it a better place are Unicorns.</p><p>Giveth wants to give power back to people while decentralizing systems. One of Giveths goals and values is to make a donation system transparent, complete and absolute. We want to make donations transparent, direct and reliable. And even if Giveth is a charity organization, we are not just talking about donations. We are talking about the structure of governance within the organization, about reliable, accountable people within the Giveth galaxy, about the fact that everyone and anyone can actively participate in the platform, the organization and the idea of Giveth. The future of giving is not just giving ether to a cause that needs support. Giving can of course be monetary but can also be work force, bodys, love, time, minds and ideas for the greater good.</p><p>A lot of people already volunteer for a good cause, give time and love to a project or an idea. Giveth is on the way to build a platform that allows any one of us to make a real change in our community, our neighborhood. I will be able to put up a cause that is important in my direct neighborhood and will make a change and a direct impact in my community — and you can too. Because, you not what? No one knows better what’s going on in your neighborhood than you. Why should anyone donate money to a big, intransparent organization that pays CEO’s instead of directly to your cause? Your community wants to teach kids how to code, you want to feed the homeless people, you want to gather a couple of people and pick up all the rubbish at your local beach/town/park? Cool, put up a cause on the Giveth platform and start to do so. Giveth believes and trusts in people and in you. This is the highest value any organization can have: the trust in people.</p><p>Shaping the future needs more than just a couple of people, it needs all of us, the human community. So we are calling everyone, to become a Unicorn and join us in the movement to #maketheworldabtterplace.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong> <a href="https://medium.com/u/7d328be176a3?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>jen Giveth</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌</p><blockquote><p><em>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>we were all going direct the other way”</em></a></p></blockquote><p><strong><em>–</em> in short the Unicorns were getting easier and easier to spot as they were coming together to reinvent the most fundamental thing there is.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Giveth is reinventing what it means to be human.</strong></p><p>Humans are not the only life form which create but we have made it our ultimate evolutionary skill. To create is to give and vice versa. Giving is the most primal expression of creating, the most basic level. To voluntarily give something that is yours ( mind, body, property…) by leaving your ownership it becomes something for somebody else. In other words : something changed, transformed, got created.</p><p>So giving, What’s so special about that? Everybody does it in one way or another. But the giving the Unicorns are talking about is voluntarily or coercion-free! This means no one can force you in any way. Nor are there gatekeepers who have the power to interfere in the process of you giving. The Giveth Unicorns credo is very clear :</p><p>• Donating can be simple, fun and effective.</p><p>• Transparency and accountability can be the default.</p><p>• Every idea has the potential to make a positive impact, and it can be heard and funded in a decentralized fashion.</p><p>• Every Donor can have the ultimate say over how their donation is used.</p><p>• People that want to do good work for their cause can be rewarded for their actions.</p><p>• Real change and innovation comes about when communities join together to make the world a better place.</p><p>Unicorns have always been elusive creatures but now the stars in the Giveth Galaxy have aligned and they are popping up everywhere. Everywhere people are noticing what is being built, being reinvented and want to contribute. The moment you give your time, your energy, your love to this community and project, and help in some way in its existence, a new Unicorn is born.</p><p>Permissionless creation will make us unstoppable. It gives hope for the future and the confidence that there will always be people who act for the good of others and that they will succeed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Xilef</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽</p><blockquote><p>There are restrictive walls that contain possibility. Inside these walls passion and motivation are strangled by bureaucracy, limitations, and unrelated political tethers. Giveth breaks down these walls and exposes possibility to the wide open expanse contained only by the one natural restriction, capacity. Giveth is where possibility meets capacity, where, passion and motivation are free to flourish and where only nature itself can restrain us.</p><p>Those with the passion to change the world sit on one side of a vast and long continent, on the other side are those who want to help them and have the resources to make their vision possible. Giveth is a canal right through the middle of that continent, removing the need to go all the way around and convincing more and more people on both sides to make the journey from the world we live in to the world we believe in.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Giveth is a decentralized platform that facilitates better giving and better receiving, contributing to creating a better world</li><li>Giveth creates increased transparency and allows results based giving for individual donors, in turn inspiring creation of more and more givers and more and more change makers</li><li>Giveth believes in connecting change makers with those who want to support their mission, allowing them to avoid the mission creep that comes with chasing semi-related funding</li><li>Giveth believes in decentralized, democratic, liquid control of donor funds</li><li>Giveth believes in maximizing each gifts potential, utilizing blockchain technology to decrease administrative cost requirements</li><li>Giveth believes in giving change makers the funds and trust they need to make the change they want to see a reality</li></ul><blockquote><p>~<a href="https://medium.com/u/5d71f4e010d?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker Williams</a></p></blockquote><p>🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗🏗</p><blockquote><p>Unicorns, previously thought of as being as elusive as they are mysterious and wondrous are in actuality easier to see than one would think and you even possess what it takes to be one. With transparency at the height of their values, however, they are just as easily looked past as they are open with their ability to share and positively impact their world. Hiding in the plain sight of the blockchain forests, these Unicorns believe in a simplicity that allow the moving parts of the world they believe in to glide seamlessly together without the need of a centralized force to guide them. They hope to give the power over sharing and donation out to the very people participating in order to stimulate a positive change of attitude and integrity for the <strong>Decentralized Altruistic Communities</strong> that they are a part of. By using this value system based on participation, innovation, transparency, and accountability the Giveth Unicorns hope to use smart contracts to put donors in charge of how their funds are used, they hope to allow that direct relationship to create a rewarding system for all who are involved so that positivity is felt at the very core of each donation. Giveth Unicorns know that sharing should feel good and that goodness has the ability to shift attitudes of the world for the better, for a more common force toward one another acting accountable and responsible for what they are putting out into the place we’re all a part of.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~Zak Perna</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨👨🏼‍🎨</p><blockquote><p>Dear Galaxy,</p><p>If you’re reading this we’ve done it, all the work the Unicorn troopers fought for was not in vain.</p><p><strong>The mission we set out to accomplish was clear:</strong></p><p><em>Create a trustless system of self governing bodies, capable of uniting around causes they choose to support.</em></p><p><em>Build a platform that fosters experimentation, collaboration and open source initiatives.</em></p><p><em>Awaken the Giver within all the citizen of this Galaxy and beyond, by showing them how and where their contributions make a difference.</em></p><p>The Centralization forces were determined to keep the Galaxy under their control, well we couldn’t let that happen, not for our sake and the sake of generations to come.</p><p>To accomplish our mission we had to do something greater than simply unseating the unjust forces.</p><p>We had to show them a better way!</p><p><strong>The way of the Unicorn.</strong></p><p>We started a battle that will never end, the fight for truth, justice and transparency between citizens and powers is one that must live on forever.</p><p>It’s up to you to keep this fight alive all throughout your Galaxy, to inspire, incite and expose the truth for all to see.</p><p>This was the cause we chose to fight for, the one we believed mattered most to our generation.</p><p>Now it’s your turn to decide, what will you fight for?</p><p>We’ve given you the tools to sculpt your future, to build your community and free yourselves.</p><p>Use them wisely and never, EVER…… <strong>Forget!</strong></p><p><strong>The way of the</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/YalorMewn/status/992864729407291392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Unicorn</strong></a> ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>~</em></strong><a href="https://medium.com/u/33144025168f?source=post_page-----19649c57c6aa--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Yalor Tackson</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p>🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗</p><blockquote><p>Giveth is a global community focused on improving the world through blockchain technology.</p><p>Trustless systems like a distributed ledger allow us to eliminate the middle man, cut down costs and provide transparency and accountability.
