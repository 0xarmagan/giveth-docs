Not only this, but it is also accused of its employees exchanging aid for sexual favours, plain and simple sexual abuse. The case has opened the door for a cry of the nonprofit sector to uncover and denounce these practises, which seem to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2018/feb/14/oxfam-allegations-are-tip-of-iceberg-sexual-harassment-and-aid-workers-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more common than one would think</a>.</p><p>Transparency and accountability in charitable donations have been put in check after the scandal broke out, with the International Development Secretary of the UK announcing a big audit of the organizations funded by public money, under <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxfam-sexual-abuse-aid-workers-haiti-prostitutes-scandal-national-crime-agency-mordaunt-latest-a8211211.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat of cutting the funding</a> if their standards are not met. Presumably, such an audit will be expensive and will not bring much to light, as the system is fundamentally opaque, spending more taxpayers’ money that could be dedicated to social impact projects.</p><p>Despite some challenges, I genuinely believe that almost every person working in the development sector is in it to help other people and that they do the best they can. Until now, we didn’t have tools that allowed for a different governance and management of large amounts of aid funds… but now we do.</p><header><h1>Campaign-based giving</h1></header><p>Nowadays, one gives money to an organization and must trust them to use it properly. The money is given a priori, being a grant from the government, from a granting organization or from individuals. Once the money is in their bank account, it’s -by design of how the banking system works- opaque to external people: we must trust them again to have proper procedures in place to avoid mismanagement of such funds i.e. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oxfam-in-haiti-it-was-like-a-caligula-orgy-with-prostitutes-in-oxfam-t-shirts-p32wlk0rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Caligula orgy with prostitutes in Oxfam T-shirts”</a>.</p><p>With <a href="http://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth</a> you will be able to see how the project is laid out, <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milestone by Milestone</a>, and how much money is required for each and every part. If a Milestone is not achieved, or the Milestone Reviewers (more on this category of validators shortly) perceive misconduct, 1) this Milestone will not be approved and paid out and 2) the Reviewer can decide to send all of the unspent funds back to the original Givers to be donated to other projects.</p><p>The most common issue raised here is: what happens if the Milestone Reviewer(s) is/are ‘greased’ by the Milestone Manager to approve an underachieved Milestone or to turn a blind eye on inappropriate behaviour? I see this as an excellent opportunity to bring together agents that have no special interest in colluding: a grassroots organization, the local community leadership, the government and an independent observer. One could decide that all of these need to agree on the validation and submit proof, similar to the videos used in Giveth’s <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RewardDAO</a>. Technically, since the figure of the Reviewer is just an Ethereum address, it can be a contract, it could be a multisig wallet held by these relevant stakeholders. Another, if slightly more complex, setup is that a percentage of all Givers to a Campaign need to approve the Milestone after reviewing proof. Using a <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Democracy</a> governance system here would naturally concentrate voting power in people that are reputable and are perceived to be neutral in this particular Campaign or even Milestone.</p><p>I see this as a side benefit of Giveth’s Campaigns: the need to be in constant communication with Milestone Reviewers and Campaign Managers creates — apart from transparency — a true Community where problems are openly discussed and input comes from all sides, because everyone has stake in the game.</p><header><h1>Communities solving problems</h1></header><p>Thinking of the bigger picture, how can we really shake the giving ‘industry’ awake? Without questioning the expertise and indubitable economies of scale and know-how transfer of the big International NGOs, Giveth enables another sort of organization: The DAC, the <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decentralized Altruistic Community</a>. Can we do better than just trust Oxfam (or any equivalent INGO) to drop out of the air and deploy their tactics? The Giveth platform can be used for validation of Campaigns and Milestones, but … maybe we could go a step further.</p><p>Imagine the creation of a true DAC in Haiti, conformed by Givers, people on the ground (the ‘Makers’) and even representation of the INGOs, all communicating with each other and through an agreed form of governance that works to pledge resources the right way. This way we can make sure that Oxfam’s expertise is allocated where it can impact the most, in constant communication with other stakeholders and with fully transparent decision making.</p><header><h1>You get some decision power, you get some more, and you get some too!</h1></header><p>Does it sound complicated? After all, you are not an expert in Haiti… maybe you’ve never even been there! How are you supposed to choose where to pledge funds or to know which Campaigns are going to be the most impactful? Giveth has got you covered. With Liquid Pledging, a concept derived from <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid democracy</a>, you can delegate the choice of your donations to Communities you perceive as experts: this can be an influential development group — Oxfam if you really must!- but also your former roommate’s social impact group, which was really into this ‘making a better world’ thing. You delegate to a DAC, and it can send your donation to its chosen Campaign, a lot like how charity is supposed to work nowadays, but with much more oversight. You will be able to track your donation, veto any decisions the delegates make and get connected to the people/communities running the Campaigns you will be funding.</p><p>Once you start down the rabbit hole, the possibilities are endless: You can delegate half of your pledged funds to a DAC specializing in disaster relief, which in turn will fund some trusted Campaigns for smaller specific problems. The other half you can delegate to your favourite Campaign focusing on improving education in your hometown or even to another DAC that brings together all education projects in your area. Be as local or global as you want!</p><img alt="Liquid pledging at work" src="/img/blog/liquidPledging.png"><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="liquid-pledging-at-work"></a>Liquid pledging at work<a class="hash-link" href="#liquid-pledging-at-work" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><header><h1>Help us solve the challenges</h1></header><p>The future is near.

One vote can now be split in any number of ways between multiple delegates or sent entirely to your chosen delegate, and your delegate can delegate to someone else. Much delegation, so democracy.</p><p>As an example take a busy college student who just doesn’t have time to vote, she could delegate ½ her vote to her mom and ½ her vote to her professor. If either of them wanted they could allocate a portion of the vote or all of it to a popular politically active persona that acts as a representative for the local community and controls an influential % of the total vote.</p><header><h1>Giveth is a perfect playground for implementing liquid democracy</h1></header><p>Of course, the reason we’re explaining liquid democracy is because it is one of the core technologies that inspired Giveth’s <a href="https://github.com/Giveth/liquidpledging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Pledging</a> system, and we see it as an important building block for the governance of <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DACs</a>.</p><p>While there is no voting inherent in Giveth’s base layer, there is an opportunity to use a governance system like liquid democracy in the various roles that are filled currently by people such as <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delegates or Reviewers</a>. This would mean that that a delegate, instead of being one person, would become a smart contract that has liquid democracy built in so that the donors can elect several delegates to decide which projects get funded (we will likely use a “liquid plutocracy” model, the more you donate the more votes you get).</p><p>But wait there’s more, with liquid democracy + blockchain you have the ability to actually codify your vote.</p><p>Yes, I know, code what?</p><p>Codifying your vote could allow you to tag different delegates to represent you based on the subject matter for the initiative. This means that if one initiative has an economic tag your vote for that initiative would be automatically allocated to the delegate you want to represent you on the economic issues, if another initiative carries the environmental tag your vote would be automatically allocated to your environmental delegate. Very diverse, much effective.</p><p>Say an important issue comes up that you feel very strongly about. You can push a button and take your voting back and vote yourself, then push a button and put your delegation settings back the way they were.</p><p>You set the term limits, you can delegate for 20 seconds or 20 years!</p><p>Liquid democracy gives everybody the ability to delegate their vote accordingly or even to overstep the position of their representative keeping them accountable for their actions on a day to day spectrum instead of year to year.</p><p>No one knows exactly what the future of voting looks like, but with Giveth we can start experimenting with this incredible model while making the world a better place at the same time!

In <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-minime-token-open-sourced-by-giveth-2710c0210787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2016</a> the team started developing the DApp (Donation Application) and is now <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coming closer</a> to the release of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In the build-up to this, we would like to take a moment to explain why we are creating the platform and give you a sneak peak of the user flow.</p><p><strong>Wait, but why?</strong></p><p>If you have ever donated to non-profits or charitable organizations chances are high your experience was similar to this one: on your way to the metro you got stopped by a convincing youth who got your name, mailing address and signature for a fixed monthly donation to a specific cause. Since that moment, a few times per year — if you’re lucky — you receive an old-school newsletter which you throw away without reading. <strong>You are left entirely in the dark about where your donation went,</strong> and the non-profit receives a monthly amount until you decide to cancel.</p><p>Giveth changes all this. As all donations are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain you can follow, in real-time, who gets your donations and why at a very granular level.</p><p>The Giveth platform has a simple result-based incentive structure: when funds are collected they are stored in our <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-vault-contract-open-sourced-by-giveth-fe2261f7b91b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault</a> and only after Milestones are completed, can the funds be withdrawn. The Giver’s funds are under their control until their donations are locked for a specific purpose.</p><p>This basic structure gives them a clear view on the various people involved in the process and the possibility to contact everyone directly. And if they don’t like what their funds are intended to be used for, they have time to block its use.</p><p>We are building the <strong>Future of Giving by cutting out the bureaucracy</strong> so that funds can be spent more efficiently and everyone can collaborate in making the world a better place.</p><p><strong>Talk the Talk</strong></p><p>We are re-engineering how donations are made, and with it, we had to reinvent the <a href="http://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">language</a> to talk about it. The 3 key building blocks of the Giveth system are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones. A <strong>DAC</strong> — short for Decentralized Altruistic Community — is the group of people united around a cause they want to support. This DAC will fund and steer multiple <strong>Campaigns</strong>, which can in their turn also be supported by more than one DAC. A Campaign translates the dreams of a DAC into a more specific agenda to which action points are linked: we call these the <strong>Milestones</strong>. Milestones are the smallest entity within the Giveth system and are the last step in our donation flow. Once completed, the funds are released into the wild to reimburse and reward good people for their good work.</p><img alt="Building Blocks of Giveth" src="/img/blog/buildingBlocksGiveth.png"><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="the-3-key-building-blocks-of-giveth-are-communities-dacs-campaigns-and-milestones"></a>The 3 key building blocks of Giveth are Communities (DACs), Campaigns and Milestones.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-3-key-building-blocks-of-giveth-are-communities-dacs-campaigns-and-milestones" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>We focus on the technology so people can focus entirely on uniting around causes. In order to do so, we need to define <strong>some of the basic roles</strong> in our system.</p><p>A <strong>Giver</strong> can donate directly to a Campaign they believe in, or can decide to pledge funds to a DAC that will allocate these funds to appropriate Campaigns in the Giver’s name — we call this process <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid pledging</a>. By donating, the Giver automatically becomes part of the DAC and is connected with the rest of the community.</p><p>The <strong>Delegates</strong> are registered DAC members that take on the task of allocating funds sent to their DAC to one or more Campaigns.</p><p>The <strong>Makers</strong> are all the people within these campaigns making the change the DACs want to see in the world. There are a few specific roles the Makers have to fulfill.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Campaign Managers</strong> are the Makers that create Campaigns, assign funds to specific Milestones and make sure their specific Campaign is a success.</li><li>The <strong>Milestone Managers</strong> are the Makers in charge of specific Milestones and need to assure these very specific actions are achieved as described.</li><li>The <strong>Recipients</strong> are the Makers that receive the funds when a Milestone is successfully completed.</li></ul><img alt="Giveth Roles" src="/img/blog/givingBlogRoles1.png"><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="main-roles-within-the-giveth-platform-giver-delegate-campaign-manager-milestone-manager-recipient"></a>Main roles within the Giveth Platform: Giver, Delegate, Campaign Manager, Milestone Manager, Recipient.<a class="hash-link" href="#main-roles-within-the-giveth-platform-giver-delegate-campaign-manager-milestone-manager-recipient" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Two additional roles have been created to <strong>guarantee the correct usage of funds</strong>.</p><ul><li>The <strong>Campaign Reviewer</strong> can reject completion of any Milestone and can, as a strong security measure, even cancel a whole Campaign if it appears to be fraudulent.</li><li>The <strong>Milestone Reviewer</strong>’s role is to confirm the Milestone Manager really achieved the proposed goal or action described in the Milestone.</li></ul><p>This brings us to the <strong>true power</strong> of the Giveth platform: at all times the Giver knows exactly what is happening to the donated funds, how these are being spent and is in full control through a <strong>transparent network of accountabilities</strong>. If a Milestone is canceled, the funds are returned to the Campaign. If a Campaign is canceled, the funds are automatically returned to the Delegates that supported it. If a Delegate quits, the funds are returned to the Giver. On top of this, one of the most revolutionary aspects of this system is that at any point up until the moment funds are locked into a Campaign, the Giver can decide to withdraw them.</p><img alt="Giveth Additonal Roles" src="/img/blog/givingBlogRoles2.png"><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="two-extra-roles-guarantee-the-correct-usage-of-funds-campaign-reviewer-and-milestone-reviewer"></a>Two extra roles guarantee the correct usage of funds: Campaign Reviewer and Milestone Reviewer.<a class="hash-link" href="#two-extra-roles-guarantee-the-correct-usage-of-funds-campaign-reviewer-and-milestone-reviewer" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>You can discover more about these roles and responsibilities by reading on in <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp/product-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the product definition</a> on our wiki.</p><p><strong>Walk the Walk</strong></p><p>The Giveth Donation Application is <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now in beta stage on testnet</a>, with all of the roles described above integrated, and currently undergoing testing with a select team of volunteers.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPXoEzuNQzc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="giveth-co-founder-griff-green-explains-what-the-giveth-donation-application-is-about"></a>Giveth co-founder Griff Green explains what the Giveth Donation Application is about.<a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-co-founder-griff-green-explains-what-the-giveth-donation-application-is-about" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>We always have opportunities for skilled developers to contribute to our project, and you can <a href="https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/finances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donate</a> to `revolution.eth` to reward and incentivize the devs that are making the Giveth platform a reality.
