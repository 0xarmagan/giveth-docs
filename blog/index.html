We have six projects from a wide range of causes that we are featuring in this project spotlight. This is also an extra special spotlight because Giveth.io itself is currently active and accepting donations on the latest round of <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gitcoin Grants</strong></a> <strong>(GR11)</strong>. If you feel inspired by the Giveth mission after reading this article then consider making a contribution via our <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/795/givethio-panvala-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grants listing</a> and learn about the magic of <em>Quadratic Funding</em>! More on that later…</p><img alt="GR11 Magic" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2Cover.gif"><p>Without further ado let’s dive in and highlight these projects that are making our DApp great!  </p><hr><img alt="ETHOS" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-1.png"><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ethos"></a><strong>ETHOS</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#ethos" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p><strong>Emergency Transitional Housing Offering Services (ETHOS)</strong> is designing funding solutions for the homelessness crisis in Olympia, Washington State. ETHOS has been championed by ‘Art Is Solidarity’ which is a local non-profit combining blockchain technology and art mediums to find solutions and funding opportunities for pressing social issues. At the heart of this project is the city’s first initiative: to combat homelessness. From ETHOS’s project description:</p><blockquote><p>“In 2018, the City of Olympia sanctioned a tent city adjacent to the transit center downtown dubbed the “Mitigation Site” for those struggling on the streets to have somewhere to rest and seek shelter. In late 2020, two-and-a-half winters and many tents later, a next step in creating a path to housing for downtowners was conceived when the City of Olympia contracted a local design and build firm to create 60 ‘micro-houses’ to replace tents and offer more security and safety for those trying to get on their feet.“</p></blockquote><p>Following the successful construction and installation of these micro-houses, Art Is Solidarity will use additional funds raised to improve upon the amenities inside the Mitigation Site in a unique way. They are engaging the help of local artists to beautify the micro-houses into works of art and mint the art pieces into NFTs to be auctioned off digitally. Proceeds of these auctions will go towards outfitting the house with furniture, heaters and more!</p><p>Art Is Solidarity also intends to educate the shelter’s inhabitants and local artists about the vast opportunities that NFTs and cryptocurrencies can offer for alternative forms of income, and provide them with the tools to get involved. Check out their <a href="https://giveth.io/project/ETHOS-Emergency-Transitional-Housing-Offering-Services-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Giveth.io</a> and donate to help the build and beautification of micro-housing, and the educational opportunities being created for the homeless in Olympia.</p><img alt="Finca Morpho" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-2.png"><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="finca-morpho"></a>Finca Morpho<a class="hash-link" href="#finca-morpho" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Nestled in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, there is a community of thriving nomads building ecological harmony at Finca Morpho. This 5-acre beachfront paradise is where humans create strong ties with each other and the land while learning a wide range of skills for a harmonized lifestyle. These skills include permaculture, bamboo building, recycling techniques, holistic medicine, renewable energy, and healthy cooking techniques.</p><p>Founded in 2014 Finca Morpho is a place for curious travelers to spend time in nature and to fully immerse themselves in communal living. They also host events and retreats to further share the important knowledge they have cultivated on the farm. They have created closed-loop recycling systems from the ground up, having found ways to completely repurpose all of their waste. From a simple sandy beach they have nurtured a thriving permaculture system complete with aquaponics, soil sanctuaries and carbon sequestration techniques. They have come a long way from their humble beginnings.</p><p>There are 7 pillars that comprise the core physical and conceptual foundations of the farm: <strong>The Kitchen, The Resource Center, Permaculture, Hospitality, Infrastructure, Project Management and Relationships</strong>. Finca Morpho is seeking funding to upgrade a few of these pillars which need a bit of love in order to maintain and improve their functions. The four pillars needing improvements are:</p><ul><li><strong>Kitchen</strong> — To keep feeding hungry mouths and processing the bounty of the land. Buying new equipment such as blenders and stoves.</li><li><strong>Resource Center</strong> — To fulfill their mission of recycling or repurposing everything they use. Purchasing a 3d printer, plastic shredder, extruder, microscope and expanding the area of the center.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> — The cabins, water storage system and solar grid they maintain are in need of love. Buying new solar batteries, renovating cabins and installing a new water storage system.</li><li><strong>Permaculture</strong> — Every season comes with new challenges and needs. Purchasing seeds, plants and trees.</li></ul><p>Check out <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Finca-Morpho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finca Morpho’s project on Giveth.io</a> and make a donation to keep this community thriving and capable of spreading its message to those who seek it, and learn more about how they do it on their <a href="https://www.fincamorpho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p><img alt="Solidity Development Course in Farsi" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-3.png"><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="solidity-development-course-in-farsi"></a>Solidity Development Course in Farsi<a class="hash-link" href="#solidity-development-course-in-farsi" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>The language and gender barriers created by the english-dominated blockchain industry severely hamper opportunities of up-and-coming demographics to fully participate in the revolutionary technology that Blockchain produces. Shayan Eskandari, the project’s creator summarizes the opportunity to provide support:</p><blockquote><p>“Farsi is spoken by an estimated 110 million speakers mostly in Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Russia, Azerbaijan and Afghanistan . . . In contrast to the West where computer engineers are predominantly men, Iran’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) graduates are about 70% women.”</p></blockquote><p>CoinIran, the project’s host organization, has built opportunities to overcome these barriers by creating unique programs for Farsi speakers, notably their latest project, “Women in Blockchain’’. This program is putting Iranian women through the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer bootcamp while providing technical and linguistic support, giving them the knowledge and skills to acquire jobs as Ethereum developers. Their initial cycle put 7 women through the course, who all passed, receiving developer certifications from ConsenSys.</p><p><strong>Making Blockchain and Cryptocurrency more accessible will only help to ensure its growth and adoption.</strong> The project is seeking funding to cover the expenses of putting the women through the course and for the costs of building the course tailored for Farsi speakers with comprehensive media, translations and syllabuses. Further funds raised will allow more women to go through the program.

It is the intelligence of nature as expressed through human thought and action.”</em>. The word is derived from the Greek word <strong><em>Oikos</em></strong>, meaning “home”. The project, Oika, is reconnecting humans with nature and raising awareness of climate change through NFT technology. Dr. Rich Blundell, the project’s creator, has gathered a team of scientists, artists and storytellers to cultivate <em>Ecological Intelligence</em>. They are combining the realms of academic ecological analysis with different artistic techniques to produce images and videos that are minted as NFTs. You can check out their creations on the <a href="https://oika.com/oika-media-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oika Media page</a>.</p><p>Oika also maintains an off-grid homestead and marine research vessel for inspired researchers to collaborate, incubating new ideas and generating knowledge. There are a wide variety of subjects that Oika advocates research on, such as:</p><ul><li>Ecological Survey &amp; Monitoring</li><li>Invasive Species Response</li><li>Pelagic/Neritic, Plastics Clean-up</li><li>Fishing Debris Location &amp; Removal</li><li>Wildlife Reporting &amp; Monitoring</li><li>Aquaculture Research</li><li>Phenology (study of climate change effects)</li><li>Citizen Science</li><li>Sci-Art Collaboration</li><li>Public Interpretation/Communication</li><li>Conservation Journalism/Documentary</li></ul><p>Oika also offers courses for teaching the concepts of Ecological Intelligence. They seek funding to continue operating their off-grid research center and to pay artists and scientists for their contributions and collaborations involved in crafting the NFTs.

Grassroots Economics is proving this concept by building open-source economies in communities throughout Kenya. Their base token. known as Community Inclusion Currency (CIC). is to be used across all their participating communities in order to quantify and redistribute the abundance of goods they produce.</p><p>Their vision is to create healthy and decentralized ecosystems by empowering locals to design their own economies. They also believe heavily in syntropic agroforestry as the main technique to provide agricultural abundance and economic value production.</p><p>They seek funding in order to build the open-source software they need in order to achieve their goals. Development currently takes place on their <a href="https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public repository on Gitlab</a>.

Rainbow Crystal Land (RCL), established in 2014, strives to create a global network of leaderless, horizontally structured communities that live in harmony with each other and the Earth. Currently they operate out of their main hub in San Agustin but are seeking to build a global community that shares their philosophy. They are mostly donation based but also sell the food they grow on the land to the local markets. All of these funds go into their “Magic Hat” which is used to buy necessary food and pay overhead costs to continue their existence.</p><p>They have written a <a href="https://rainbowcrystal.land/document/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive handbook</a> detailing many aspects of their organization, including their declaration of Common Intention as well as their Mission, Vision and Values. On the land they maintain several houses for families and dormitories for their human inhabitants. They operate a solar grid for closed-loop electricity provision and also a permaculture farm on their 14 hectare plot of land.</p><p>RCL is seeking funding to improve much of their existing infrastructure. They are hoping to purchase treated bamboo and other wood to finish building their housing projects. Tools and plant supplies need to be bought to begin putting to use their recently acquired land. Funding also is always needed to feed their citizens, namely, those who are working hard to build their utopian vision.

They provide resources for disaster relief workers and environmental conservationists. The biodiversity contained in Costa Rica cannot be understated and the preservation of the plethora of unique flora and fauna in this region is paramount to the Multiversity’s mission. They currently steward a land area of 1235 acres located within the Barra del Colorado National Refuge which has been designated by UNESCO as one of most important places for natural conservation.</p><p>Currently, Colorado Multiversity operates out of a biological station called “El Zota”, which is one of the Multiversity’s partners. El Zota carries out research and training for those who are passionate about conservation and biodiversity. There is also The Refuge Project, another one of the Multiversity’s organizations, that utilizes the facility as a safe space for disaster relief workers worldwide to meet, rest, teach and learn.</p><p>The Colorado Multiversity has been recognized by some notable organizations for potential funding, including the SDG Impact Fund, Gaia Gives and the Spanish Cooperation.

In Vancouver the homeless population is ever-present and expanding. The temperate climate of southern BC has allowed this region to become a year-round hub for the Canadian demographic experiencing homelessness. The problem in Chilliwack is exacerbated as the city of Vancouver rounds up the homeless on one-way buses to Chilliwack, dropping them off in the town with no return.</p><p>Feeding the hungry is a simple and powerful gesture. David’s trusty team, consisting of him and his daughter, plans to create food packages to hand out to the population experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack. David is seeking funding to purchase ingredients for the food packages, cover gas costs and pay for lodging expenses. At the time of writing this article, David’s team is gearing up and getting ready to execute their plan in the coming weeks. Funds contributed to this project will allow them to scale their mission and feed more people. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Feed-the-Hungry-in-Chilliwack-BC-Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth.io</a>, make a donation and stay tuned for updates in the near future!</p><img alt="Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight3.png"><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="women-of-crypto-art-woca"></a>Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)<a class="hash-link" href="#women-of-crypto-art-woca" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Have launched an inclusive community to celebrate, support and connect the women in the crypto art space.

The entire country faces extreme food security challenges, driven by political and environmental factors. This project is dedicated to finding food security solutions for one of the most important, yet vulnerable groups in society: the children. The project’s owner, Tim Olsson, believes that satisfying the nutritional needs of children allows them to focus on their education and development. Children will create the future of tomorrow and providing them with the means to succeed will help them overcome the challenges we still face today.</p><p>Vukani’s immediate goal is to grow food to nourish the local school children. Research is needed to find an agricultural system that works in the unique conditions of Zimbabwe. Once an effective system is found by the initial pilot project, their aim is to scale up and one day serve the entire country. Progress has been made for finding a water source but more infrastructure needs to be acquired to effectively distribute it for irrigation. Funds to this project will help make purchases for water pumps and solar-powered irrigation systems.

We improved upon our email notifications, ensuring that Givers and Makers receive confirmation when a donation is made.</p><p>We developed and implemented automated testing for the create-a-project flow and updated the <a href="https://docs.giveth.io/docs/testing-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing guidelines</a> in our documentation — two measures to ensure that new features work as intended.</p><p>We also addressed a few bugs: ensured that cancelled projects don’t show up in the projects list, fixed pricing, and rerouted external links for xDai donations to blockscout.</p><p>One of our all-star developers also surprised us this past sprint with a proof of concept: building Giveth.io using Next.js and Vercel instead of Gatsby and Netlify. Once we make sure all our functionality is bug-free, this change will drastically improve the UX. We’re talking faster site build, fewer issues on loading and updating, and an overall snappier site experience.</p><p>In the future, we’re going to be enhancing the UI so Makers will be able to upload photos via Unsplash when editing or creating a project. We are in the process of updating our Join, About, Contact and Support sections to the most recent info. We are also still working on the integration of an embedded chat bridged directly to our team, and project/profile verification using 3box or other.</p><p>Finally, the most exciting update to share is that we are working on giving the site a little makeover. We won’t give too much away, but here’s a little sneak peak of the new design:</p><img alt="Working on a New Look for Giveth.io" class="center" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening3img2.jpg"><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="working-on-a-new-look-for-givethio"></a>Working on a New Look for Giveth.io<a class="hash-link" href="#working-on-a-new-look-for-givethio" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>We want to extend a huge thank you to our community for all your support so far!

Nate Bressler realized while on photo-assignment shooting Native American horse racing teams for Outside Magazine, that a winter horse riding facility would greatly benefit the community of Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He teamed up with Lakota Native, Stan Brewer, the driving force behind Pine Ridge’s horse community and Angela Smith, who grew up in Utah and has been involved in nonprofits her whole life. Together, they created lofty but attainable goals that will bring structure, education, celebration, along with the opportunity for these Native youth to lift their chins with pride.</p><p>This project hopes to provide an after-school program for kids 8–18 focused on equine relationships in an indoor horse riding arena. Students of the program will be granted the opportunity to learn and grow while carrying on a traditional relationship with the very animal that made their ancestors’ survival possible. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/sage-to-saddle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Sage to Saddle on Giveth here!</a></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="conscious-medicine-collective"></a><strong>Conscious Medicine Collective</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#conscious-medicine-collective" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>dreams to create a one-of-a-kind psychedelic consciousness center.

Both a graphic novel and motion comic, it is set in a future African nation that tells the story of Moraa, a young woman who learns about blockchain and uses it to protect her homeland from cultural and ecological destruction. By using storytelling to educate readers about blockchain technology, they hope to inspire African youth to see a bright future and link them to the training to create it. Currently Anne and her team are partnered with groups in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa. The book will cover the basics of blockchains and cryptocurrency, and provide resources and links to their African-based educational partners. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/trust-graphic-novel-and-motion-comic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can find their Giveth project here.</a></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="bloom-network"></a><strong>Bloom Network</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#bloom-network" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>represents an international community of people and projects working toward regenerative cultures.

There are tens of thousands of initiatives solving major social and environmental problems, who are excluded from mainstream media and institutional finance because the way they work is naturally collaborative and polycentric. Three big picture goals the Bloom Network hopes to achieve are:</p><ul><li>Inspire a billion acts of regeneration.</li><li>Build capacity and relationships across regenerative culture initiatives.</li><li>Transfer power and resources to decentralized networks.</li></ul><p>Contributions made to their project will go towards “Regenerative Actions Ticker” on their homepage, DAO templates that local Bloom chapters can use to fund the coordination labor of actions and launch the “Call to Bloom” that will help 100+ local Blooms get started as centers of regenerative action in their cities. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/bloom-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donate to Bloom Network on Giveth.io!</a></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="must-have-crypto"></a><strong>Must Have Crypto</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#must-have-crypto" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>is a Cryptocurrency project based out of Kenya led by Mutinda Kisio.

We also added more tokens to our list in order to allow the Giver to donate with even more flexibility!</p><p>We onboarded a new member into our dev team and thanks to him we now have functional automated testing that allows us to make changes to the DApp in development and then push to our testing site with greater confidence.</p><p>Next we tackled a bigger fish: the development and implementation of a quality score, sorting/filtering method, and search function to add greater flow and organization to the projects page.</p><img alt="Magic Sorting" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1Meme.gif" width="375" height="auto"><p>Now the projects are sorted by default using a “quality score” — a combination of number of likes, number of donations and quality of project description. We have also added the ability for the user to filter projects by category, and to change the sorting method from the default to “number of likes” or “amount raised”.</p><p>Lastly, you are now able to use the search bar to quickly and easily find the exact project you want to view or Give to!</p><img alt="Filter and Sort on Giveth.io" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1img1.png" width="800" height="auto"><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio"></a>“Filter by Category”, “Sort By” and “Search Projects” Features on <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth.io</a><a class="hash-link" href="#filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>Another exciting update is that we’re now using <a href="https://segment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segment</a> analytics and <a href="https://www.autopilothq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autopilot</a> to track activity on the DApp and send appropriate corresponding notifications. We also worked on some internal organization in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/JftjK8Un3z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> that enables us to receive notifications so we can monitor site actions (such as new project creation, new donation, etc.) in-house.</p><p>In the next sprint we’re excited to continue with QA by getting email notifications working smoothly and ensuring that the donation amount (at time of donation) is being calculated and added to the database correctly. We also plan to add rich text formatting to the project creation flow, and enable the Maker to add videos and/or images to their project description. Furthermore, we are now developing systems for project verification to increase the quality of projects on the DApp.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will be investigating fiat integration for on-ramping and off-ramping solutions, and continuing to work on creating a white-label option.</p><p>As always, we are committed to building the future of giving based on feedback from you, our community!

WOW! Much Excite! The pre-existing Giveth henceforth will be known as Giveth TRACE. The <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Giveth.io Donation Application</a> is an important continuation of our mission to build the future of giving. Both iterations will continue to exist and do contain different features. In this article we’ll be diving into the nitty gritty to help you decide which version of Giveth will aid you the most on your philanthropic venture.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="tldr-←"></a><a href="#summary">TL;DR</a> ←<a class="hash-link" href="#tldr-←" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Three key distinguishers of the Giveths are: <strong><em>Trust</em></strong>, <strong><em>User Experience,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Scope</em></strong>. Let’s dive in.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="trust"></a><strong><em>Trust</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>First up let’s talk about Trust. Giveth TRACE (Originally Giveth Beta) was launched in 2017. Following <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the great DAO hack</a> from the previous year, the burning question at the time was: how do we make these new decentralized innovations resilient and trustworthy? Giveth itself was on the frontlines of these events and set out to solve these issues.</p><p>Giveth TRACE employs smart contracts to handle various transparency-oriented functions of the platform. These interactions happen on the blockchain, including traceable donations, escrow, and dispersal of funds. It uses Milestones for specific projects or goals that can have conditions outlined for funds to be released. An example would be to prove work was done on a project or that money was spent to acquire something specific. The milestone contract is employed to act as an escrow. A milestone creator can designate a recipient other than themselves and also a reviewer. The reviewer of a milestone is responsible to assure that any stated expectations were completed before authorizing the smart contract to release the funds to the recipient.</p><p>The new Giveth DApp does not use smart contracts to facilitate donations but instead provides a true peer-to-peer experience where funds go directly from donor to receiver. The resulting transaction is eternally scribed onto the blockchain. There are no escrow or reviewer functions on the Giveth.io DApp so while donations are much more direct, you are encouraged to do your due diligence before donating.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="user-experience"></a><strong><em>User Experience</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#user-experience" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Following the rise of ‘cryptokitties’ and the mooning of the price of ETH in 2018, the Rinkeby test network was implemented on Giveth TRACE to resolve absurd gas fees and scalability issues. This allows users to interact with smart contracts on the Dapp for no actual fees, using only gas on Rinkeby to execute the majority of contract transactions. In fact, Giveth actually pays the fees to send your donations to mainnet.</p><img alt="" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/cryptokitties.png" width="450" height="auto"><p><strong><em>“The Rise and Fall of Ethereum circa 2018 AD”</em></strong></p><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="image-source-mediumcom"></a>Image Source: medium.com<a class="hash-link" href="#image-source-mediumcom" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>Profile creation on Giveth TRACE is facilitated by smart contract interactions on Rinkeby and is reasonably straightforward, however is currently limited to MetaMask. Giveth TRACE currently allows donations in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC and USDC.</p><p>Giveth.io has expanded giving capabilities by allowing donations in ETH and any ERC-20 Token on Mainnet and <a href="https://www.xdaichain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>xDai network</strong></a>! The <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth.io DApp</a> uses Onboard.js to permit virtually any Ethereum wallet to be used for donations. Project creation has been streamlined, so creators can sign-in, make a project and start collecting funds literally in minutes. For creating a profile you may choose between standard MetaMask login or Torus Wallet. Torus Wallet also provides a crypto on-ramping feature so you can convert your cold-hard cash into cryptocurrency very easily and get to donating in the digital age. <a href="https://docs.tor.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More Info on Torus wallet can be found here.</a></p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="scope"></a><strong><em>Scope</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#scope" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Scope  is the last, but perhaps coolest, distinction I want to mention. Giveth TRACE has <strong>huge</strong> scope: its donation hierarchy is broken down into Communities (formerly known as DACs), Campaigns, and Milestones. Donations made to Communities and Campaigns are stored in a ‘pledge’ vault. The Community or Campaign manager can then delegate your pledge into the Campaign or Milestone, respectively, of their choosing. This system created by Giveth has coined the term ‘Liquid Pledging’ and in effect allows for curated donor funds. This means would-be donors can make non-custodial contributions to causes that they care about and funds can find their way to the right place at the right time. Once your funds have been delegated you’re able to track where they went on Giveth TRACE.</p><p>Giveth.io Dapp aims to provide a simpler experience. While not achieving the same scope of Giveth TRACE it is much easier to navigate. Donations made on Giveth.io go straight A → B and the project owners themselves dictate the scope by the projects they choose to create.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="to-summarize"></a><span id="summary"><strong><em>To Summarize:</em></strong></span><a class="hash-link" href="#to-summarize" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="giveth-trace"></a><em>Giveth TRACE</em><a class="hash-link" href="#giveth-trace" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><ul><li>Allows for donations on macro and micro levels via Communities, Campaigns, and Milestones</li><li>Has a system of oversight to prevent misuse or fraud</li><li>Donations accepted in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC, and USDC</li><li>Curated Donor Funds via ‘Liquid Pledging’</li><li>Giveth doesn’t charge any fees, in fact we pay the fees to send funds to the recipient</li><li>Works with MetaMask</li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="givethio"></a>Giveth.io<a class="hash-link" href="#givethio" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><ul><li>Streamlined project creation accessible for all</li><li>Multi-wallet functionality</li><li>Peer-to-peer transactions</li><li>Giveth doesn’t charge any fees</li><li>Fiat donations via Torus On-ramping</li><li>ETH and ERC-20 token donations</li><li>Donate on <strong>xDai</strong> and save on gas</li></ul><p>The new Giveth is straightforward if you’re looking to make simple donations peer to peer without any added complexity but with more connectivity. Giveth TRACE allows you to define how broad or narrow your donations are while maintaining a high standard of transparency and checks on fund flow.
