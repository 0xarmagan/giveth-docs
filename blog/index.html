As in any good experiment, discoveries arose from these iterations and in October 2021, the rGIV DAO voted to retire the rGIV token in favor of creating a new instance (nrGIV) with several configuration changes, including the move from 1,111 to 1, ditching the extra digits.</p><p><strong><em>Also changed in this new rGIV DAO: the distribution of tokens now follows a Fibonacci sequence. This means that the number of tokens minted for each contributor in the latest period is equal to the sum of the two previous two periods.</em></strong></p><p>As shown, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOfficeMystic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dani</a> has been contributing since day 1. She earned 1 token to vote with the first period (1,111 — which was converted to 1 in the new simplified DAO), 2 tokens for the second period, 3 tokens the third period (because 1 + 2 = 3), and 5 tokens the fourth period (because 2 + 3 = 5). If she stops contributing there, she will retain her total balance of 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11 nrGiv tokens for voting on governance proposals after the 4th period. If she continues consistently contributing to the Giveth Community, she will always have at least 1 token more than any contributors that came in later.</p><img alt="the nrGIV DAO token holders" src="/img/blog/rgivDAOtokenHolders.png"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/positonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a> is a co-founder of the rGIV DAO, and received tokens for periods 1, 2, and 3. He resigned during the 3rd period to focus on <a href="https://toucan.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toucan.earth</a>, and did not contribute during the 4th period, so does not qualify for the minting of 5 tokens. His voting weight remains at 6 tokens, while current contributors weight grows to 11. In this case where a past contributor does not return for 6 months and misses 2 full periods, their voting weight is now lower than a new contributor receiving nrGIV tokens during those two mintings.</p><p>So in this example, new contributors in periods 4 and 5 receive 8 tokens (3 + 5) bringing their total to 12 (5 + 8) — double that of James. When James returns, he will come in with his previous token weight and after another 3 months of contributions, qualifies to again receive nrGIV tokens.</p><p>In this way new contributors can gain as much influence as someone who has contributed in the prior two time periods, and over time the influence of past contributors is reduced after exiting the community. Behind this design is an assumption that those currently contributing can make the most informed vote about current governance of the organization. For consistent contributors who have been around from the beginning, those joining later will never reach or surpass your voting power, incentivizing retention of talent and wisdom for the community while incrementally fractionalizing the lead.</p><blockquote><p>Successful decentralized governance has been shown to require a healthy balance of new contributors being valued early, and long-time contributors valued for carrying the vital threads of vision, mission and information on the organization from past experience.</p></blockquote><p>Note: If you are on maternity or paternity leave, you still get the period’s token allocations during leave.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="what-is-the-nrgiv-token-used-for"></a>What is the nrGIV token used for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-nrgiv-token-used-for" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Voting on proposals that build the #FutureofGiving</strong></p><p>Anyone can make a proposal to the rGIV DAO, whether they are an nrGIV token holder or not. But first! Giveth follows a Sociocratic proposal-forming process by soliciting opinions and clarifying questions initially, then making revisions and polling for support via an Advice Process on our forum.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Previously hosted on</strong> <a href="https://www.loomio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Loomio</strong></a><strong>, you can see the proposal process</strong> <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/4TKQjvCg/configuring-giveth-dao-rep-token-on-aragon-1hive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>used to initiate the rGIV DAO</strong></a> <strong>here!</strong></p></blockquote><p>In 2021 Giveth revised its organizational structure into new Circles and Working Groups while launching a <a href="https://forum.giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new proposal management method on Discourse</a>:</p><img alt="the giveth forum" src="/img/blog/rgivDAOforum.png"><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="from-off-chain-advice-to-on-chain-voting"></a>From Off-chain Advice to On-chain Voting<a class="hash-link" href="#from-off-chain-advice-to-on-chain-voting" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>After a proposal has been reviewed, the champion (person writing and advocating for the proposal) can post a new Vote to the rGIV DAO! Once made, nrGIV token holders have 5 days to use their tokens and vote “yes” or “no”. Voting on each proposal in this DAO allocates your fully accrued nrGIV token quantity; and you do not lose them if you vote. In other words, if you have 7 tokens, and you vote “yes,” then 7 nrGIV tokens are added to the total “yes” votes while the tokens remain in your wallet. When you vote on other proposals, you still have 7 nrGIV tokens to vote on those as well.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Giveth Reputation DAO does not use Conviction Voting or require you to “stake” your reputation tokens — you never lose your tokens or have to choose which proposal to use them on; you always have the same number of tokens to vote with for each new proposal.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In order for a proposal to pass, it must have a majority of yes votes, and reach a “minimum approval” level, which we’ve set at 25%. If a proposal doesn’t have more than 25% of all minted tokens voting yes on it, it automatically does not pass regardless of the distribution of “yes” and “no” votes given. However, the proposal can always be proposed again and voted on again.</p><p>The second metric within each vote is the “Support” level. We have set that at 88%. If a vote reaches this level, it has more than the majority by a large margin and is labeled as having strong support.

Untangling our relationship, as humans, with plastic will be one of the great challenges of our time. UPF Coin is a project by Unplastify which, as the name implies, is on a mission to put the brakes on our consumption of plastic. Unplastify is based out of Argentina and the USA, and provides a wide range of educational and practical activities promoting unplastification.</p><p>Their primary area of interest is the crippling effects of plastic waste in our oceans. To that end in 2018 they embarked on an epic oceanic adventure where the team took off on a sailboat named “Fanky” across the Atlantic and back, collecting plastic samples and researching impacts and alternatives to plastic. Their voyage took them from the ports of New York City all the way to Corsica and back across the pond to Buenos Aires, Argentina. You can check out more of the work unplastify does on <a href="https://www.unplastify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.</p><p>The UPF Coin project introduces the powerful realities of blockchain and tokenization to their noble cause. At the heart of this lies a proprietary UPF blockchain which operates on a “proof of unplastify work” to distribute UPF coins. Every coin minted represents one tonne of avoided plastic consumption. Unplastification work done will be human validated by the UPF team. They plan to have a working blockchain and 25 UPF coins emitted by the end of this quarter! That’s 25 tonnes of plastic mitigated. Donations to their project will help them research and fund the deployment of the UPF token economy. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/upf-coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out UPF Coin on giveth.io</a> and make a donation!</p><img alt="Positive Blockchain" src="/img/blog/positiveBlockchain.png"><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="positive-blockchain"></a>Positive Blockchain<a class="hash-link" href="#positive-blockchain" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>With an ever-increasing emergence of ‘blockchain-for-good’ projects, how can anyone keep up with all these amazing high vibes?

The game-changing dynamics of blockchain are pervasive across an expansive list of modern industries. CineFi is introducing a platform to revolutionize funding and revenue streams from film-making.</p><p>The CineFi Network begins with artists submitting proposals for films they’re inspired to create. A CineFi token (CINE) will be the medium through which users can interact with proposals and films. Platform users can decide whether or not to invest funds (CINE) into bringing the film proposals into fruition. If the film reaches its funding goal a fractilized NFT is generated which represents proportional rights to creators and investors of the film, guaranteeing a cut of the revenues generated. The platform also allows users to stream or purchase these decentrally financed films with the same CINE tokens.</p><p>By this novel system, CineFi effectively allows for real-time community signalling for what films they want to see made. Thanks to Blockchain technology, creators and artists can more transparently navigate the terms on which they share revenues generated from their works. The blockchain becomes the final source of truth for where the fractalized NFTs are distributed, where funding comes from and where revenues go.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://cinefi.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CineFi website</a> we can hope to see film proposals rolling in by around mid-2022.

In Africa, these challenges create troubling disparities between populations. The Good Work Foundation (GWF) is focused on closing this gap and raising the bar. They have created a wide range of educational programmes with a focus on digital literacy. The programmes offered go from primary school students all the way to post-secondary specialized training for adults.</p><p>On Giveth, GWF is raising funds particularly for their Open Learning Academy programme, which focuses on young students in rural South Africa. On the project page they mention the staggering statistics they’re grappling with:</p><p><em>“In</em> <strong><em>rural South Africa</em></strong><em>, of 100 South African children that start school, approximately 60 will reach and write matric (high-school graduation exam), 37 will pass, and 12 will access university. This crippling problem will be even more exacerbated going into 2022.”</em></p><p>The programme intends to reach over 9,000 students from grade 4 to 8 in the municipality of Bushbuckridge in South Africa. The Open Learning Academy allows rural schools to outsource coding, robotics and digital literacy programmes to the GWF learning centre. The programme intends to support existing curriculums, rather than diverge from them, allowing participating children to build relevant skills to continue their education.

DAOs represent not just a technological blockchain breakthrough, but also a cultural force to be reckoned with. DAOs in effect allow organizations to form organically and continually evolve, leaning on blockchain transparency and computer-aided governance systems. The technology we use to create DAOs is constantly iterating upon itself however we as humans remain as the constant base layer, “<strong><em>Layer 0</em></strong>”.</p><p>The DAOist is a DAO (aptly so) that intends to capture this social phenomenon and to incubate resulting ideas, collaboration and cultural practices. This takes form as live and virtual events held around existing events in the Ethereum community. They host conferences where DAO champions can come and share experience and knowledge and to build partnerships with other value-aligned communities.</p><p>Their first event was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBV5All5yM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris for EthCC4 in July of 2021</a>. It was a huge success and the people demanded more, so they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5aUHWDU7jg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosted a second one in Lisbon</a>, in October, of the same year. Their instant success has only proven that there’s a real desire to open up a space for DAOs to share and learn. To that end, they want to create educational spaces, physical and virtual, to empower DAOs. They are also in the process of defining their DAO structure. The DAOist is seeking funds in order to continue to host events and to create a year-round space for DAO enthusiasts to meet, collaborate and learn.

They are creating donation pathways to empower several native tribes, and are propagating holistic practices to restore our connection with the Earth. They currently support four tribal villages in the region:</p><ul><li><strong>Yawanawa — Shukuvena</strong> (“Toucan” in the local language) — Praised for fostering strong female leaders, this tribe is focused on agroforestry, food sovereignty, natural medicines and spiritual practices.</li><li><strong>Huni Kui — Pinuya</strong> (“Hummingbird” in the local language) — Residing in the northern zone of Acre, the village of Pinuya is making huge leaps in reforestation efforts and crop laying. They are focused on yielding saplings and food surpluses with the intention to move away from tourism and find alternative income sources.</li><li><strong>Huni Kui — Caucho</strong> — Dwelling in the basins of the rivers Juruà and Purus, the village of Caucho strives to reclaim their culture from the shocks of colonial industrialization. The Amazon Rubber Boom eroded much of their ancestral culture. They believe in sowing their culture through music, dance and art.</li><li><strong>Kuntanawa</strong> or “Coconut People” — Believe that plants are the way to connect with the spirits of the forest. They have mastered how to cure their people with traditional medicines and plan to cure the world by creating alliances of communities committed to restore the balance of nature.</li></ul><p>Each tribe boasts dozens of families living on their ancestral land, which collectively is spread out over hundreds of thousands of hectares of Amazonian rainforest. These peoples steward their land, implementing traditional agroforestry techniques, as well as ply their artisanal craft-making skills.

The Handshake Development (HNS) Fund is the community funding the Handshake protocol and affiliated systems. HNS at its core is a system for distributing internet domain names using cryptocurrency technology. The HNS protocol website hits home the need for better domain name distribution framework:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Names on the internet (top level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system which are relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. . . . Services on the internet have become more centralized beginning in the 1990s, but do not fulfill the original decentralized vision of the internet. . . . Centralization exists because there is a need to manage spam, griefing, and sockpuppet/sybil attacks. Previous decentralized systems largely stopped working due to spam. If it were more costly to grief on the internet using decentralized systems, the need for trusted centralized corporations to manage these risks decrease.”</em></p></blockquote><p>HNS uses a token (aptly named HNS) to register domain names. Using these cryptographic tokens, participants can transfer and update their registered names. By creating a decentralized and accountable system, HNS (by way of its users) can inhibit a centralized actor from scooping up all the domain names. The HNS Fund seeks out donations to keep afloat their open-source tools, such as DNS records, domain registries, and educational content. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/handshake-development-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth.io</a> and make a donation to support HNS public goods!</p><img alt="Njome Innovation Academy" src="/img/blog/NjombeIA.png"><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="njombe-innovation-academy"></a>Njombe Innovation Academy<a class="hash-link" href="#njombe-innovation-academy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>is creating the next generation of African entrepreneurs in Njombe, Tanzania. Njombe Innovation Academy (NIA) is importing the Social Innovation Academy (SINA) educational model which began in Uganda. The premise of SINA is to invite members of marginalized african demographics with passion and ideas to a co-living experience to gain the entrepreneurial skills to make their dreams a reality. SINA has proven to be extremely successful, tackling prevailing African issues around failing education systems and corresponding unemployment rates. Njombe Innovation Academy profoundly lays out their <strong>Theory for Change</strong>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The desired impact (of NIA) is an increased number of social challenges tackled in Njombe by youth-led enterprises with locally available resources. . . . we will bootstrap a self-organised community of youth in Njombe who commonly owns(sic) and manages(sic) resources (material, knowledge, financial, social) to create social enterprises out of challenges . . . “</em></p></blockquote><p>SINA communities have been spreading around the continent and Uganda is ready, more than ever, for it’s own local SINA node. NIA identifies that local youth unemployment hovers around 10% with more than 40% never completing secondary school. Crippling rates of malnutrition and HIV hamper the societal and economic growth of Njombe.</p><p>Njombe Innovation Academy has outlined a clear plan for kick-starting the local SINA community. The first step is to send 3 local youth from Njombe to Uganda to gain insight from the original SINA. Then, with supporting members and facilities, these successful graduates begin to train subsequent cohorts of entrepreneurs. In 2 years they are targeting to put over 50 youth through the local Njombe SINA program and generate nearly a dozen new enterprises as a result. 50% of these participants will be women and a further 15% will be people with disabilities. All participants will come from poverty based backgrounds.</p><p>To learn more of NIA milestones, their funding targets and to make a donation, visit <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Njombe-Innovation-Academy-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project on Giveth.io</a>.

Utilizing music, culture, and art they have mobilized hands to create and maintain localized nodes of permaculture in over 65 cities for the last 5 years. In more concrete terms, this is executed via <strong>Permaculture Action Days;</strong> an event which organizes various activities including workshops and discussion panels, often in partnership with local music festivals or cultural events. During the event, participants are channeled to aid in the construction of permaculture infrastructure, such as community gardens, rainwater catchment systems and greenhouses.</p><p>The heart of activity during the event is the <strong>Permaculture Action Hub</strong>. This is the physical place which brings in curious festival attendees to learn a wide variety of subjects, ranging from alternative economies to mushroom cultivation.</p><p>Also featured during Action Days are <strong>Permaculture Action Courses</strong>. These  are free, hands-on classes that teach regenerative ecological techniques and socio-economic structures for individuals and communities.</p><p>Adapting to the pandemic, the Permaculture Action Network has begun building their next interactive tool: the Just Transition Map. This map will show locations of community spaces and projects that are creating better alternatives to the current extractive economy. This will be a tool for the global environmental justice movement to coordinate and create action.

ETHOS has been championed by ‘Art Is Solidarity’ which is a local non-profit combining blockchain technology and art mediums to find solutions and funding opportunities for pressing social issues. At the heart of this project is the city’s first initiative: to combat homelessness. From ETHOS’s project description:</p><blockquote><p>“In 2018, the City of Olympia sanctioned a tent city adjacent to the transit center downtown dubbed the “Mitigation Site” for those struggling on the streets to have somewhere to rest and seek shelter. In late 2020, two-and-a-half winters and many tents later, a next step in creating a path to housing for downtowners was conceived when the City of Olympia contracted a local design and build firm to create 60 ‘micro-houses’ to replace tents and offer more security and safety for those trying to get on their feet.“</p></blockquote><p>Following the successful construction and installation of these micro-houses, Art Is Solidarity will use additional funds raised to improve upon the amenities inside the Mitigation Site in a unique way. They are engaging the help of local artists to beautify the micro-houses into works of art and mint the art pieces into NFTs to be auctioned off digitally. Proceeds of these auctions will go towards outfitting the house with furniture, heaters and more!</p><p>Art Is Solidarity also intends to educate the shelter’s inhabitants and local artists about the vast opportunities that NFTs and cryptocurrencies can offer for alternative forms of income, and provide them with the tools to get involved. Check out their <a href="https://giveth.io/project/ETHOS-Emergency-Transitional-Housing-Offering-Services-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Giveth.io</a> and donate to help the build and beautification of micro-housing, and the educational opportunities being created for the homeless in Olympia.</p><img alt="Finca Morpho" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-2.png"><header><h1>Finca Morpho</h1></header><p>Nestled in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, there is a community of thriving nomads building ecological harmony at Finca Morpho. This 5-acre beachfront paradise is where humans create strong ties with each other and the land while learning a wide range of skills for a harmonized lifestyle. These skills include permaculture, bamboo building, recycling techniques, holistic medicine, renewable energy, and healthy cooking techniques.</p><p>Founded in 2014 Finca Morpho is a place for curious travelers to spend time in nature and to fully immerse themselves in communal living. They also host events and retreats to further share the important knowledge they have cultivated on the farm. They have created closed-loop recycling systems from the ground up, having found ways to completely repurpose all of their waste. From a simple sandy beach they have nurtured a thriving permaculture system complete with aquaponics, soil sanctuaries and carbon sequestration techniques. They have come a long way from their humble beginnings.</p><p>There are 7 pillars that comprise the core physical and conceptual foundations of the farm: <strong>The Kitchen, The Resource Center, Permaculture, Hospitality, Infrastructure, Project Management and Relationships</strong>. Finca Morpho is seeking funding to upgrade a few of these pillars which need a bit of love in order to maintain and improve their functions. The four pillars needing improvements are:</p><ul><li><strong>Kitchen</strong> — To keep feeding hungry mouths and processing the bounty of the land. Buying new equipment such as blenders and stoves.</li><li><strong>Resource Center</strong> — To fulfill their mission of recycling or repurposing everything they use. Purchasing a 3d printer, plastic shredder, extruder, microscope and expanding the area of the center.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> — The cabins, water storage system and solar grid they maintain are in need of love. Buying new solar batteries, renovating cabins and installing a new water storage system.</li><li><strong>Permaculture</strong> — Every season comes with new challenges and needs. Purchasing seeds, plants and trees.</li></ul><p>Check out <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Finca-Morpho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finca Morpho’s project on Giveth.io</a> and make a donation to keep this community thriving and capable of spreading its message to those who seek it, and learn more about how they do it on their <a href="https://www.fincamorpho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p><img alt="Solidity Development Course in Farsi" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-3.png"><header><h1>Solidity Development Course in Farsi</h1></header><p>The language and gender barriers created by the english-dominated blockchain industry severely hamper opportunities of up-and-coming demographics to fully participate in the revolutionary technology that Blockchain produces. Shayan Eskandari, the project’s creator summarizes the opportunity to provide support:</p><blockquote><p>“Farsi is spoken by an estimated 110 million speakers mostly in Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Russia, Azerbaijan and Afghanistan . . . In contrast to the West where computer engineers are predominantly men, Iran’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) graduates are about 70% women.”</p></blockquote><p>CoinIran, the project’s host organization, has built opportunities to overcome these barriers by creating unique programs for Farsi speakers, notably their latest project, “Women in Blockchain’’. This program is putting Iranian women through the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer bootcamp while providing technical and linguistic support, giving them the knowledge and skills to acquire jobs as Ethereum developers. Their initial cycle put 7 women through the course, who all passed, receiving developer certifications from ConsenSys.</p><p><strong>Making Blockchain and Cryptocurrency more accessible will only help to ensure its growth and adoption.</strong> The project is seeking funding to cover the expenses of putting the women through the course and for the costs of building the course tailored for Farsi speakers with comprehensive media, translations and syllabuses. Further funds raised will allow more women to go through the program.

Currently they operate out of their main hub in San Agustin but are seeking to build a global community that shares their philosophy. They are mostly donation based but also sell the food they grow on the land to the local markets. All of these funds go into their “Magic Hat” which is used to buy necessary food and pay overhead costs to continue their existence.</p><p>They have written a <a href="https://rainbowcrystal.land/document/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive handbook</a> detailing many aspects of their organization, including their declaration of Common Intention as well as their Mission, Vision and Values. On the land they maintain several houses for families and dormitories for their human inhabitants. They operate a solar grid for closed-loop electricity provision and also a permaculture farm on their 14 hectare plot of land.</p><p>RCL is seeking funding to improve much of their existing infrastructure. They are hoping to purchase treated bamboo and other wood to finish building their housing projects. Tools and plant supplies need to be bought to begin putting to use their recently acquired land.

They provide resources for disaster relief workers and environmental conservationists. The biodiversity contained in Costa Rica cannot be understated and the preservation of the plethora of unique flora and fauna in this region is paramount to the Multiversity’s mission. They currently steward a land area of 1235 acres located within the Barra del Colorado National Refuge which has been designated by UNESCO as one of most important places for natural conservation.</p><p>Currently, Colorado Multiversity operates out of a biological station called “El Zota”, which is one of the Multiversity’s partners. El Zota carries out research and training for those who are passionate about conservation and biodiversity. There is also The Refuge Project, another one of the Multiversity’s organizations, that utilizes the facility as a safe space for disaster relief workers worldwide to meet, rest, teach and learn.</p><p>The Colorado Multiversity has been recognized by some notable organizations for potential funding, including the SDG Impact Fund, Gaia Gives and the Spanish Cooperation.

In Vancouver the homeless population is ever-present and expanding. The temperate climate of southern BC has allowed this region to become a year-round hub for the Canadian demographic experiencing homelessness. The problem in Chilliwack is exacerbated as the city of Vancouver rounds up the homeless on one-way buses to Chilliwack, dropping them off in the town with no return.</p><p>Feeding the hungry is a simple and powerful gesture. David’s trusty team, consisting of him and his daughter, plans to create food packages to hand out to the population experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack. David is seeking funding to purchase ingredients for the food packages, cover gas costs and pay for lodging expenses. At the time of writing this article, David’s team is gearing up and getting ready to execute their plan in the coming weeks. Funds contributed to this project will allow them to scale their mission and feed more people. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Feed-the-Hungry-in-Chilliwack-BC-Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth.io</a>, make a donation and stay tuned for updates in the near future!</p><img alt="Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight3.png"><header><h1>Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)</h1></header><p>Have launched an inclusive community to celebrate, support and connect the women in the crypto art space.

The entire country faces extreme food security challenges, driven by political and environmental factors. This project is dedicated to finding food security solutions for one of the most important, yet vulnerable groups in society: the children. The project’s owner, Tim Olsson, believes that satisfying the nutritional needs of children allows them to focus on their education and development. Children will create the future of tomorrow and providing them with the means to succeed will help them overcome the challenges we still face today.</p><p>Vukani’s immediate goal is to grow food to nourish the local school children. Research is needed to find an agricultural system that works in the unique conditions of Zimbabwe. Once an effective system is found by the initial pilot project, their aim is to scale up and one day serve the entire country. Progress has been made for finding a water source but more infrastructure needs to be acquired to effectively distribute it for irrigation. Funds to this project will help make purchases for water pumps and solar-powered irrigation systems.

Harnessing the knowledge of Syntropic Farming they have launched their project along the lush rural roads of Costa Rica. According to Devin &amp; Arthur, Free the Food’s co-founders, Syntropic Farming is the gateway to restoring ecological diversity, creating wildlife habitats and holistically super-charging the generation of delicious and healthy food.</p><p>They have already begun with three streetside syntropic plantations to grow food, with more sites on the way. Their grand vision is to create a network of streetside syntropics and to engineer a grants system allowing new communities to spring up, acquiring the knowledge to begin propagating these regenerative food sources.

We released our MVP DApp in 2018 to be beta tested by the Giveth Galaxy, but faced huge obstacles. Scope creep, maintenance of a complex system, and an overly complicated user experience prevented a quick release, and then we simply ran out of funding. We were close to “calling it quits” on our original DApp in favour of a simpler, <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user-friendly version</a> that we would design from scratch.</p><p>Fortunately for Givers everywhere, our all-star devs refused to give up.

For now, if you want to verify your project, fill <a href="https://hlfkiwoiwhi.typeform.com/to/pXxk0HO5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out this typeform</a> and reach out in the #project-onboarding channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/nVSbGSHaaD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p><header><h1>Accountability</h1></header><p>Campaigns represent the big picture for each project — projects use Campaigns to collect traceable donations and manage them transparently. Under each Campaign there can be multiple “<a href="/dapps/leavingTraces">Traces</a>”, i.e. payments, bounties, or expenses. Traces specify how the project is using their donations to achieve the goals of the overarching Campaigns. When a Giver donates to a Campaign they can follow the flow of their donations. Whenever donations are moved from a Campaign to a Trace, the Giver is notified and can see exactly how their donations are used.</p><p>Traces are the only way for donations to leave Giveth TRACE.

The project’s creator, Mugisha, states that in rural Burundi up to <strong>58% of children suffer from malnutrition</strong> and communities often have no access to medical services. Agriculture and livestock can represent up to 95% of a village’s commercial activities, yet families still struggle to get enough food to sustain themselves.</p><p>PVC Burundi began in 2015 and is teaching rural communities how to implement regenerative systems for improving education, agriculture and healthcare. Activities focus on soil regeneration, organic waste recycling, tree planting, and of course, growing food. PVC Burundi provides healthcare access to communities in exchange for tree-planting services, incentivizing a healthy environment in tandem with healthy humans.</p><p>Food sold in markets via Village Communities are used to fund PVC’s healthcare and education initiatives. Every year they launch “Community Reconciliation” where they expose new communities to different regenerative techniques, begin tree planting campaigns and bring food to market. Currently, one of their main goals is to extend their healthcare facilities in Burundi.</p><p><a href="https://giveth.io/project/CREATING-THE-PERFECT-VILLAGES-IN-BURUNDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Perfect Villages in Burundi</a> and help spread the regenerative movement in Africa!</p><img alt="Bridging Digital Communities" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinal2.png"><header><h1>Bridging Digital Communities</h1></header><p>Is run by a Digital Wizard by the name of Kay.

He has been creating and maintaining bridge servers for applications such as Discord, Telegram or Riot and has never charged anyone to make these connections.

Based on their simple approach focused on “Connection, Compassion and Vital Supplies” they have been serving communities across the US for the last 6 years.</p><p>On the Spread the Love project page they state that anywhere between 600,000 to 1.5 million people experience homelessness across the country, and with Covid-19 financial support ending soon, that number is likely to rise. With only one employee, Spread the Love Commission needs to grow in order to meet these rising challenges. So far they have served over 30 communities and with Giver support they hope to serve many more.</p><p>Spread the Love Commission aims to remove the stigma of homelessness and connect those stuck in a vicious cycle with support from those who are ready to offer it.

A common challenge in Tanzania is solid waste management, including in Njombe. Mettodo, the project’s creator states:</p><blockquote><p>‘ 35 tons of solid waste is generated daily by the town: 28 tons are taken to a dumpsite, where the waste is usually burned . . . 10 % of the solid waste is plastic waste: 3,500 kg of per day, which is equal to 1000 tons of plastic waste every year.’</p></blockquote><p>Njombe Beyond is working hard to reduce the plastic wasted in Njombe town. Their three specific objectives are:</p><ul><li>Establish a small scale value chain for recycling plastics within the local community.</li><li>Collaborate with stakeholders of the program and ensure fair working conditions.</li><li>Involve schools and local communities in Njombe Beyond to bring awareness to the problems and opportunities of plastic waste.</li></ul><p><a href="https://giveth.io/project/njombe-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Njombe Beyond’s project on Giveth!</a></p><p>When we first set out on the change-maker campaign we had decided to wrap things up on the 12th of May, but after some discussion we have decided to <strong>extend the change-maker campaign</strong> indefinitely.

Nate Bressler realized while on photo-assignment shooting Native American horse racing teams for Outside Magazine, that a winter horse riding facility would greatly benefit the community of Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He teamed up with Lakota Native, Stan Brewer, the driving force behind Pine Ridge’s horse community and Angela Smith, who grew up in Utah and has been involved in nonprofits her whole life. Together, they created lofty but attainable goals that will bring structure, education, celebration, along with the opportunity for these Native youth to lift their chins with pride.</p><p>This project hopes to provide an after-school program for kids 8–18 focused on equine relationships in an indoor horse riding arena.
