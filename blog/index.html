More on that later…</p><img alt="GR11 Magic" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2Cover.gif"><p>Without further ado let’s dive in and highlight these projects that are making our DApp great!  </p><hr><img alt="ETHOS" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-1.png"><header><h1><strong>ETHOS</strong></h1></header><p><strong>Emergency Transitional Housing Offering Services (ETHOS)</strong> is designing funding solutions for the homelessness crisis in Olympia, Washington State. ETHOS has been championed by ‘Art Is Solidarity’ which is a local non-profit combining blockchain technology and art mediums to find solutions and funding opportunities for pressing social issues. At the heart of this project is the city’s first initiative: to combat homelessness. From ETHOS’s project description:</p><blockquote><p>“In 2018, the City of Olympia sanctioned a tent city adjacent to the transit center downtown dubbed the “Mitigation Site” for those struggling on the streets to have somewhere to rest and seek shelter. In late 2020, two-and-a-half winters and many tents later, a next step in creating a path to housing for downtowners was conceived when the City of Olympia contracted a local design and build firm to create 60 ‘micro-houses’ to replace tents and offer more security and safety for those trying to get on their feet.“</p></blockquote><p>Following the successful construction and installation of these micro-houses, Art Is Solidarity will use additional funds raised to improve upon the amenities inside the Mitigation Site in a unique way. They are engaging the help of local artists to beautify the micro-houses into works of art and mint the art pieces into NFTs to be auctioned off digitally. Proceeds of these auctions will go towards outfitting the house with furniture, heaters and more!</p><p>Art Is Solidarity also intends to educate the shelter’s inhabitants and local artists about the vast opportunities that NFTs and cryptocurrencies can offer for alternative forms of income, and provide them with the tools to get involved. Check out their <a href="https://giveth.io/project/ETHOS-Emergency-Transitional-Housing-Offering-Services-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Giveth.io</a> and donate to help the build and beautification of micro-housing, and the educational opportunities being created for the homeless in Olympia.</p><img alt="Finca Morpho" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-2.png"><header><h1>Finca Morpho</h1></header><p>Nestled in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, there is a community of thriving nomads building ecological harmony at Finca Morpho. This 5-acre beachfront paradise is where humans create strong ties with each other and the land while learning a wide range of skills for a harmonized lifestyle. These skills include permaculture, bamboo building, recycling techniques, holistic medicine, renewable energy, and healthy cooking techniques.</p><p>Founded in 2014 Finca Morpho is a place for curious travelers to spend time in nature and to fully immerse themselves in communal living. They also host events and retreats to further share the important knowledge they have cultivated on the farm. They have created closed-loop recycling systems from the ground up, having found ways to completely repurpose all of their waste. From a simple sandy beach they have nurtured a thriving permaculture system complete with aquaponics, soil sanctuaries and carbon sequestration techniques. They have come a long way from their humble beginnings.</p><p>There are 7 pillars that comprise the core physical and conceptual foundations of the farm: <strong>The Kitchen, The Resource Center, Permaculture, Hospitality, Infrastructure, Project Management and Relationships</strong>. Finca Morpho is seeking funding to upgrade a few of these pillars which need a bit of love in order to maintain and improve their functions. The four pillars needing improvements are:</p><ul><li><strong>Kitchen</strong> — To keep feeding hungry mouths and processing the bounty of the land. Buying new equipment such as blenders and stoves.</li><li><strong>Resource Center</strong> — To fulfill their mission of recycling or repurposing everything they use. Purchasing a 3d printer, plastic shredder, extruder, microscope and expanding the area of the center.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> — The cabins, water storage system and solar grid they maintain are in need of love. Buying new solar batteries, renovating cabins and installing a new water storage system.</li><li><strong>Permaculture</strong> — Every season comes with new challenges and needs. Purchasing seeds, plants and trees.</li></ul><p>Check out <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Finca-Morpho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finca Morpho’s project on Giveth.io</a> and make a donation to keep this community thriving and capable of spreading its message to those who seek it, and learn more about how they do it on their <a href="https://www.fincamorpho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p><img alt="Solidity Development Course in Farsi" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight2-3.png"><header><h1>Solidity Development Course in Farsi</h1></header><p>The language and gender barriers created by the english-dominated blockchain industry severely hamper opportunities of up-and-coming demographics to fully participate in the revolutionary technology that Blockchain produces. Shayan Eskandari, the project’s creator summarizes the opportunity to provide support:</p><blockquote><p>“Farsi is spoken by an estimated 110 million speakers mostly in Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Russia, Azerbaijan and Afghanistan . . . In contrast to the West where computer engineers are predominantly men, Iran’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) graduates are about 70% women.”</p></blockquote><p>CoinIran, the project’s host organization, has built opportunities to overcome these barriers by creating unique programs for Farsi speakers, notably their latest project, “Women in Blockchain’’. This program is putting Iranian women through the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer bootcamp while providing technical and linguistic support, giving them the knowledge and skills to acquire jobs as Ethereum developers. Their initial cycle put 7 women through the course, who all passed, receiving developer certifications from ConsenSys.</p><p><strong>Making Blockchain and Cryptocurrency more accessible will only help to ensure its growth and adoption.</strong> The project is seeking funding to cover the expenses of putting the women through the course and for the costs of building the course tailored for Farsi speakers with comprehensive media, translations and syllabuses. Further funds raised will allow more women to go through the program.

It is the intelligence of nature as expressed through human thought and action.”</em>. The word is derived from the Greek word <strong><em>Oikos</em></strong>, meaning “home”. The project, Oika, is reconnecting humans with nature and raising awareness of climate change through NFT technology. Dr. Rich Blundell, the project’s creator, has gathered a team of scientists, artists and storytellers to cultivate <em>Ecological Intelligence</em>. They are combining the realms of academic ecological analysis with different artistic techniques to produce images and videos that are minted as NFTs. You can check out their creations on the <a href="https://oika.com/oika-media-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oika Media page</a>.</p><p>Oika also maintains an off-grid homestead and marine research vessel for inspired researchers to collaborate, incubating new ideas and generating knowledge. There are a wide variety of subjects that Oika advocates research on, such as:</p><ul><li>Ecological Survey &amp; Monitoring</li><li>Invasive Species Response</li><li>Pelagic/Neritic, Plastics Clean-up</li><li>Fishing Debris Location &amp; Removal</li><li>Wildlife Reporting &amp; Monitoring</li><li>Aquaculture Research</li><li>Phenology (study of climate change effects)</li><li>Citizen Science</li><li>Sci-Art Collaboration</li><li>Public Interpretation/Communication</li><li>Conservation Journalism/Documentary</li></ul><p>Oika also offers courses for teaching the concepts of Ecological Intelligence. They seek funding to continue operating their off-grid research center and to pay artists and scientists for their contributions and collaborations involved in crafting the NFTs.

Grassroots Economics is proving this concept by building open-source economies in communities throughout Kenya. Their base token. known as Community Inclusion Currency (CIC). is to be used across all their participating communities in order to quantify and redistribute the abundance of goods they produce.</p><p>Their vision is to create healthy and decentralized ecosystems by empowering locals to design their own economies. They also believe heavily in syntropic agroforestry as the main technique to provide agricultural abundance and economic value production.</p><p>They seek funding in order to build the open-source software they need in order to achieve their goals.

Rainbow Crystal Land (RCL), established in 2014, strives to create a global network of leaderless, horizontally structured communities that live in harmony with each other and the Earth. Currently they operate out of their main hub in San Agustin but are seeking to build a global community that shares their philosophy. They are mostly donation based but also sell the food they grow on the land to the local markets. All of these funds go into their “Magic Hat” which is used to buy necessary food and pay overhead costs to continue their existence.</p><p>They have written a <a href="https://rainbowcrystal.land/document/handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive handbook</a> detailing many aspects of their organization, including their declaration of Common Intention as well as their Mission, Vision and Values. On the land they maintain several houses for families and dormitories for their human inhabitants. They operate a solar grid for closed-loop electricity provision and also a permaculture farm on their 14 hectare plot of land.</p><p>RCL is seeking funding to improve much of their existing infrastructure. They are hoping to purchase treated bamboo and other wood to finish building their housing projects. Tools and plant supplies need to be bought to begin putting to use their recently acquired land. Funding also is always needed to feed their citizens, namely, those who are working hard to build their utopian vision.

Read on to discover some of our favourite projects from a diverse range of causes using our DApps.</p><img alt="Colorado Multiversity" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight1.png"><header><h1>Colorado Multiversity</h1></header><p>Is a partnership of local and international organizations based in the Northern Caribbean side of Costa Rica. They provide resources for disaster relief workers and environmental conservationists. The biodiversity contained in Costa Rica cannot be understated and the preservation of the plethora of unique flora and fauna in this region is paramount to the Multiversity’s mission. They currently steward a land area of 1235 acres located within the Barra del Colorado National Refuge which has been designated by UNESCO as one of most important places for natural conservation.</p><p>Currently, Colorado Multiversity operates out of a biological station called “El Zota”, which is one of the Multiversity’s partners. El Zota carries out research and training for those who are passionate about conservation and biodiversity. There is also The Refuge Project, another one of the Multiversity’s organizations, that utilizes the facility as a safe space for disaster relief workers worldwide to meet, rest, teach and learn.</p><p>The Colorado Multiversity has been recognized by some notable organizations for potential funding, including the SDG Impact Fund, Gaia Gives and the Spanish Cooperation. They are seeking initial funding to kick-start their mission and meet the funding criteria outlined by these organizations. They have a wide range of projects being launched including decarbonization initiatives, international volunteering programs, agricultural development research and plastic recycling.

In Vancouver the homeless population is ever-present and expanding. The temperate climate of southern BC has allowed this region to become a year-round hub for the Canadian demographic experiencing homelessness. The problem in Chilliwack is exacerbated as the city of Vancouver rounds up the homeless on one-way buses to Chilliwack, dropping them off in the town with no return.</p><p>Feeding the hungry is a simple and powerful gesture. David’s trusty team, consisting of him and his daughter, plans to create food packages to hand out to the population experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack. David is seeking funding to purchase ingredients for the food packages, cover gas costs and pay for lodging expenses. At the time of writing this article, David’s team is gearing up and getting ready to execute their plan in the coming weeks. Funds contributed to this project will allow them to scale their mission and feed more people. <a href="https://giveth.io/project/Feed-the-Hungry-in-Chilliwack-BC-Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find their project on Giveth.io</a>, make a donation and stay tuned for updates in the near future!</p><img alt="Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)" src="/img/blog/communitySpotlight3.png"><header><h1>Women of Crypto Art (WOCA)</h1></header><p>Have launched an inclusive community to celebrate, support and connect the women in the crypto art space.

The entire country faces extreme food security challenges, driven by political and environmental factors. This project is dedicated to finding food security solutions for one of the most important, yet vulnerable groups in society: the children. The project’s owner, Tim Olsson, believes that satisfying the nutritional needs of children allows them to focus on their education and development. Children will create the future of tomorrow and providing them with the means to succeed will help them overcome the challenges we still face today.</p><p>Vukani’s immediate goal is to grow food to nourish the local school children. Research is needed to find an agricultural system that works in the unique conditions of Zimbabwe. Once an effective system is found by the initial pilot project, their aim is to scale up and one day serve the entire country. Progress has been made for finding a water source but more infrastructure needs to be acquired to effectively distribute it for irrigation. Funds to this project will help make purchases for water pumps and solar-powered irrigation systems.

Scope creep, maintenance of a complex system, and an overly complicated user experience prevented a quick release, and then we simply ran out of funding.

Traces specify how the project is using their donations to achieve the goals of the overarching Campaigns. When a Giver donates to a Campaign they can follow the flow of their donations. Whenever donations are moved from a Campaign to a Trace, the Giver is notified and can see exactly how their donations are used.</p><p>Traces are the only way for donations to leave Giveth TRACE.

The project’s creator, Mugisha, states that in rural Burundi up to <strong>58% of children suffer from malnutrition</strong> and communities often have no access to medical services. Agriculture and livestock can represent up to 95% of a village’s commercial activities, yet families still struggle to get enough food to sustain themselves.</p><p>PVC Burundi began in 2015 and is teaching rural communities how to implement regenerative systems for improving education, agriculture and healthcare. Activities focus on soil regeneration, organic waste recycling, tree planting, and of course, growing food. PVC Burundi provides healthcare access to communities in exchange for tree-planting services, incentivizing a healthy environment in tandem with healthy humans.</p><p>Food sold in markets via Village Communities are used to fund PVC’s healthcare and education initiatives. Every year they launch “Community Reconciliation” where they expose new communities to different regenerative techniques, begin tree planting campaigns and bring food to market. Currently, one of their main goals is to extend their healthcare facilities in Burundi.</p><p><a href="https://giveth.io/project/CREATING-THE-PERFECT-VILLAGES-IN-BURUNDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Perfect Villages in Burundi</a> and help spread the regenerative movement in Africa!</p><img alt="Bridging Digital Communities" src="/img/blog/changeMakersFinal2.png"><header><h1>Bridging Digital Communities</h1></header><p>Is run by a Digital Wizard by the name of Kay.

Nate Bressler realized while on photo-assignment shooting Native American horse racing teams for Outside Magazine, that a winter horse riding facility would greatly benefit the community of Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He teamed up with Lakota Native, Stan Brewer, the driving force behind Pine Ridge’s horse community and Angela Smith, who grew up in Utah and has been involved in nonprofits her whole life. Together, they created lofty but attainable goals that will bring structure, education, celebration, along with the opportunity for these Native youth to lift their chins with pride.</p><p>This project hopes to provide an after-school program for kids 8–18 focused on equine relationships in an indoor horse riding arena.

This is one part of a series of short transparency posts where we keep you in the loop with updates on what’s in development for</em> <a href="http://giveth.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>giveth.io</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Our new DApp <a href="/blog/futureofGiving">went live</a> at <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giveth.io</a> on March 24, 2021, and since then we got some great feedback from our testers and community, and we’ve been hard at work fixing bugs and adding new features.</p><p>First, we addressed the issue of gas fees not being calculated correctly, added an informative banner, and enabled users to login directly on xDai chain. We disabled the ability of a project creator to use a contract address for their project so that donations to all projects can be done either on Mainnet or xDai. We also added more tokens to our list in order to allow the Giver to donate with even more flexibility!</p><p>We onboarded a new member into our dev team and thanks to him we now have functional automated testing that allows us to make changes to the DApp in development and then push to our testing site with greater confidence.</p><p>Next we tackled a bigger fish: the development and implementation of a quality score, sorting/filtering method, and search function to add greater flow and organization to the projects page.</p><img alt="Magic Sorting" class="leftfloat" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1Meme.gif" width="375" height="auto"><p>Now the projects are sorted by default using a “quality score” — a combination of number of likes, number of donations and quality of project description. We have also added the ability for the user to filter projects by category, and to change the sorting method from the default to “number of likes” or “amount raised”.</p><p>Lastly, you are now able to use the search bar to quickly and easily find the exact project you want to view or Give to!</p><img alt="Filter and Sort on Giveth.io" src="/img/blog/whatsDappening1img1.png" width="800" height="auto"><h6><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h6 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio"></a>“Filter by Category”, “Sort By” and “Search Projects” Features on <a href="https://giveth.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giveth.io</a><a class="hash-link" href="#filter-by-category-sort-by-and-search-projects-features-on-givethio" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h6><p>Another exciting update is that we’re now using <a href="https://segment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segment</a> analytics and <a href="https://www.autopilothq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autopilot</a> to track activity on the DApp and send appropriate corresponding notifications. We also worked on some internal organization in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/JftjK8Un3z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> that enables us to receive notifications so we can monitor site actions (such as new project creation, new donation, etc.) in-house.</p><p>In the next sprint we’re excited to continue with QA by getting email notifications working smoothly and ensuring that the donation amount (at time of donation) is being calculated and added to the database correctly. We also plan to add rich text formatting to the project creation flow, and enable the Maker to add videos and/or images to their project description. Furthermore, we are now developing systems for project verification to increase the quality of projects on the DApp.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will be investigating fiat integration for on-ramping and off-ramping solutions, and continuing to work on creating a white-label option.</p><p>As always, we are committed to building the future of giving based on feedback from you, our community!
