title: How do GIVBacks work?
---
Recurring Distribution of GIVBacks will happen in bi-weekly rounds, the amount of GIVBacks to be distributed will be announced before the start of each round.

GIVBacks will be given to users who made donations to verified projects on the Giveth.io DApp. A Maximum of 75% of the dollar amount value can be received in GIVBacks.

If 75% of the total dollar value amount of donations eligible for GIVBacks in a round is less than the total dollar value amount of all the GIVBacks available for distribution for that round then all eligible participants will receive the maximum 75% in value as GIVBACKS. The remainder of GIVBacks not distributed will return to the GIV pool.

If 75% of the total dollar value amount of donations eligible for GIVBacks in a round EXCEEDS the total dollar value amount of the GIVBacks available for distribution then the GIVBack percentage will be calculated by dividing the total dollar value amount of GIVBacks against the total dollar value amount of donations made in that round. This percentage will be distributed equally among all participants in that round.

### Examples

**Round 1**
10,000 GIV is available this round

In total, $80,000 were collected by verified projects in 2 weeks. and GIV drastically rose in price to $10 per GIV. Because 75% of $80k is $60k only 6000 GIV will be distributed that round, the 4000 GIV will go back into the GIVBack Pool.

**Round 2**
10,000 GIV is available this round

In total, $200,000 were collected by verified projects in 2 weeks. and GIV rose again in price to $12 per GIV. Because 75% of $200k is $150k the entire 10,000 GIV (worth 120k) will be distributed that round... every Giver will get a 60% GIVBack.

### Cheating
Verified project donation history will be reviewed regularly.

There will be severe consqeuences if a project creator tries to game the system and loop their GIVBack donations back into their project. (i.e Making a donation to your own project, collecting GIVBacks and donating those GIVBacks to your project.) All donors to that project will not receive GIVBacks that round. The project will lose their verified status and potentially may have their project removed entirely from Giveth.io.
