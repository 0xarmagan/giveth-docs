## We Are Hiring a Backend Developer!

**Giveth has a great reputation and a powerful legacy to uphold.**

Created in 2016 by the White Hat Group, rising like a phoenix out of the ashes of TheDAO, Giveth is a very well respected member of the Ethereum community. Most notably we created the [Minime Token](https://medium.com/giveth/the-minime-token-open-sourced-by-giveth-2710c0210787) and [Liquid Pledging](https://medium.com/giveth/liquid-democracy-what-that-bd3c63e8df52), which have been adopted by many notable projects in the space. Every DAO that that uses Aragon's framework is using our Minime token contracts and Status used Liquid Pledging to build [Assemble](https://assemble.fund/#/) for it's own fund management. In 2017, our team [rescued 210 million dollars from vulnerable Parity multisigs](https://mashable.com/2017/07/26/ethereum-stolen-white-hat-group-rescued/) at a Giveth all-hands meeting, returning it within a week.

Our focus now is in building a cryptoeconomic system that can reward good people for giving to good projects. It is sad that this is a revolutionary, idea. But it is!  Giveth is poised to become the easiest way for the value-driven, collective-focused magic-makers of the world to access the revolutionary funding streams that the crypto space (especially the Ethereum community) is dreaming up.

If you want to glimpse a piece of this vision… Griff Green’s talk at ETHCC in 2019 is probably the best overview of it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ23oQpooG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ23oQpooG0)

### Who are we looking for?
We are looking for an experienced backend developer responsible for managing the interchange of data between the server and the users. Your primary focus will be the development of all server-side logic, definition and maintenance of the central database, and ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end. Ideally, you are someone who is focused, dedicated, fluent in English, with a track record of successfully developing and launching crypto projects remotely. We love passionate people and hope to find someone excited about helping nonprofits by helping us **Build the Future of Giving**.

We are dedicated to building systems that appreciate value creation in the care work and stewardship of Public Goods which is currently under appreciated. Giveth is the critical interface that allows the legacy world to connect to the blockchain revolution that can value this important work and make it regenerative.

A desire to cooperate with our allies in this effort, like Gitcoin, clr.fund, WeTrust, and others is the only attitude that is required to join this organization. Otherwise we prefer to have a diversity of opinion and temperament styles. :-D
